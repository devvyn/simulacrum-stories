<VOICE:NARRATOR>The salt wind carried more than the usual scent of brine and rotting kelp today. Thomas Breck stood at the edge of his dock, coiling rope with practiced hands while his eyes kept drifting to the canvas tarp in the bottom of his boat. Three days now since he'd hauled it up in his nets, and three sleepless nights wondering what the hell he was supposed to do about it. The thing sat there like a guilty secret, and Thomas had enough of those to last a lifetime. The afternoon sun was starting to slant low, casting long shadows between the weathered pilings, when he heard footsteps on the dock behind him.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Mr. Breck? I hope I'm not interrupting your work.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He turned to see the new woman - Sarah something, the one who'd been asking questions around town about the bay. She had that earnest look city folks got when they came to the waterfront, like they were expecting to find truth in the smell of fish guts and diesel fuel. Behind her walked Margaret Holloway, looking uncomfortable in her good shoes on the wet planking.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>Miss Chen, isn't it? No interruption. Just tidying up before the tide turns.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="formal">Thomas, Miss Chen has some questions about the fishing conditions lately. I told her you'd know better than anyone what's been coming up in the nets.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The words hit Thomas like cold water. His hands stilled on the rope, and he could feel his heart picking up pace. Of all the things to ask about right now. He glanced back at his boat, where that damned tarp seemed to be glowing like a beacon.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="careful">Fishing conditions? Well, they've been... unusual lately, I'll give you that.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Unusual how? I've been documenting some concerning patterns in the marine life. Dead fish, mammals with strange markings. Have you noticed anything like that?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Thomas felt sweat beading on his forehead despite the cool breeze. The woman was getting too close to things that were better left alone. But there was something in her voice - a genuine worry that reminded him of his own daughter when she was small and afraid of thunder.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>I've seen some things, sure. Fish dying off, seals acting strange. Been fishing these waters forty years, and it's not... it's not right.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The dock creaked under their feet, and Thomas heard another set of footsteps approaching. He looked up to see Eleanor Cross walking toward them with that measured pace of hers, like she owned every board of the waterfront. Which, knowing Eleanor, she probably did in some way or another.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Good evening, Thomas. Ladies. I heard there was some discussion about our local waters.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="deferential">Mrs. Cross. Miss Chen was just asking about fishing conditions.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor's sharp eyes moved from Sarah to Thomas, and he felt like a schoolboy caught with his hand in the cookie jar. The old woman had a way of seeing right through people, and Thomas wondered if she could sense the weight of what lay hidden in his boat just twenty feet away.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>I see. And what have you told her, Thomas?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="defensive">Just the truth. That things have been strange lately. Fish dying, patterns changing.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Mrs. Cross, I'm trying to understand what might be causing these changes. Any historical context would be helpful. Has anything like this happened before?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The silence that followed felt heavy as fog. Thomas watched Eleanor's face, saw something flicker behind her eyes - not quite fear, but something close to it. The wind picked up, rattling the rigging on nearby boats, and he could smell rain coming in from the west.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="measured">The bay has always had its moods, Miss Chen. Sometimes the old patterns resurface. Thomas, I'm sure you remember what your father used to say about respecting the water's secrets.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The mention of his father made Thomas's chest tighten. The old man had indeed warned him about keeping quiet, about not stirring up trouble that was better left buried. And now here Thomas was, with something in his nets that could turn the whole town upside down if the wrong people found out about it.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="quiet">He said a lot of things about keeping quiet.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="pressing">But surely if there's something affecting the ecosystem, something that could help explain what's happening now-</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="firm">Some questions, Miss Chen, are better left unasked. Don't you agree, Thomas?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Thomas felt the weight of three pairs of eyes on him. Sarah's hopeful and determined, Margaret's nervous and expectant, Eleanor's knowing and warning. Behind him, his boat rocked gently in the tide, that tarp-covered secret seeming to grow heavier with each passing second. He thought about his father's warnings, about the safety of keeping quiet. But he also thought about the dead fish, the sick seals, and the look of genuine concern in Sarah's eyes. Forty years of keeping other people's secrets, and now he had one of his own that might actually matter.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="conflicted">Mrs. Cross... with all due respect... maybe some secrets have been kept too long already.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>
