<VOICE:NARRATOR>The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the weathered planks of the waterfront, each groaning timber seeming to whisper warnings I'd carried for decades. I stood at the edge of the main dock, watching the tide pull away from the pilings, revealing the dark stains that never quite washed clean. The salt air carried more than just the scent of kelp and fish today—it carried the weight of decisions that could no longer be postponed. Sarah Chen's research was getting too close, asking the right questions in the wrong places. And now she'd called this meeting, her voice tight with the kind of determination that reminded me painfully of another young woman who'd once stood on these same docks, notebook in hand, seeking answers that Millbrook wasn't ready to give.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Mrs. Cross, thank you for coming. I know this is unusual, asking everyone to meet here like this.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>I studied Sarah's face, noting the familiar set of her jaw, the way she held her shoulders when she'd made up her mind about something. Margaret stood slightly behind her, protective instincts warring with civic duty written in every line of her posture. Thomas had positioned himself near the boat slips, close enough to listen but ready to disappear if the conversation turned dangerous. Smart man. They all thought I was here because of my position in town, because my opinion carried weight with the development committee. They had no idea I was here because I was the only one left who remembered what we'd buried beneath these docks, or that Sarah's grandmother had died trying to expose it.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross>You said this was about the fish kills, dear. And the development plans.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="determined">It is. But it's more than that now. The patterns I've been tracking, the contamination levels—they don't match what should be coming from current industrial activity. Whatever's causing this has been there for a long time.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="cautious">Sarah, we've been through this. The cannery's been following regulations for years now. If there are legacy issues—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="firm">This isn't about the cannery, Margaret. The contamination signature is different. Older. And it's concentrated right here, around these specific dock pilings.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>My chest tightened as Sarah gestured toward the exact spot where we'd sunk the barrels forty-three years ago. The winter of 1909, when the previous marine biologist—Sarah's grandmother, though she didn't know it—had gotten too close to the truth about what the original mill owners had been dumping. Thomas shifted uncomfortably, and I wondered if his father had told him the stories before he died, or if he was just picking up on the tension crackling between us like electricity before a storm.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="wary">What exactly are you saying, Miss Chen?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>I'm saying that if we let them start construction without a proper investigation, we might disturb something that should stay buried. The marine life that's washing up—the deformities, the poisoning—it's like nothing I've seen in current literature. But I found references to similar incidents in archived reports from the early 1900s.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross tone="carefully neutral">Old reports can be unreliable, dear. Different times, different methods of documentation.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>But even as I spoke, I could see the skepticism in Sarah's eyes. She was too smart, too thorough. Just like her grandmother had been. The question wasn't whether she'd uncover the truth—it was whether I could find a way to help her understand it without destroying everything we'd worked to protect. Margaret was watching me carefully, sensing undercurrents she couldn't name. The town's safety had always been my responsibility, but now I had to decide: was that safety worth preserving a lie that was slowly poisoning the very waters we'd tried to protect?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="pressing">Mrs. Cross, you've lived here longer than anyone. You must remember the stories, even if they weren't official. What happened to the marine biologist who was here in 1909? Dr. Chen—she had the same last name as me, and I can't find any record of what happened to her research.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The name hung in the air like a challenge, and I felt the weight of forty-three years of silence pressing against my ribs. Sarah didn't know she was asking about her own bloodline, didn't know that her presence here was more than coincidence. But looking into her eyes—those same dark, determined eyes that had once looked up at me from her grandmother's face—I realized that some secrets were too heavy for one person to carry forever. The question was whether Millbrook was finally ready for the truth, or whether revealing it would destroy more lives than it saved.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross tone="measured">Some stones, dear, are better left unturned. But perhaps... perhaps it's time we talked about why they were placed there in the first place.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor_Cross>
