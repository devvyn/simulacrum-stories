<VOICE:NARRATOR>The morning fog clings to the weathered planks of the dock like secrets refusing to lift. Sarah stands at the water's edge, her notebook clutched against her chest, watching the tide pull back to reveal the dark pilings beneath. The smell of brine and rotting kelp fills her nostrils, but there's something else underneath—something chemical and wrong that she's been documenting for weeks. The fishing boats creak in their moorings, their hulls scarred by years of salt and weather. She's here early again, drawn by the same compulsion that's been eating at her since she arrived in Millbrook. The water holds answers, she's certain of it, but every time she thinks she's close to understanding, the town seems to close ranks around its secrets.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>The patterns are getting worse.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>She speaks to the empty dock, her voice barely audible over the lapping waves. Behind her, footsteps approach on the wooden planks—measured, deliberate. Sarah turns to see Margaret Holloway walking toward her, flanked by Thomas Breck and another woman Sarah doesn't recognize. The stranger is elderly but carries herself with unmistakable authority, her silver hair pinned back severely, her dark coat pristine despite the damp morning air. Margaret's expression is carefully neutral, but Sarah catches the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers worry at the clipboard she carries.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="cautious">Miss Chen, I'd like you to meet Eleanor Cross. She's... been wanting to speak with you.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor Cross steps forward, her pale eyes studying Sarah with an intensity that makes her skin crawl. There's something familiar about those eyes, though Sarah can't place where she might have seen them before. Thomas hangs back, his weathered hands shoved deep in his pockets, his gaze fixed on the water as if he'd rather be anywhere else.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Miss Chen. I understand you've been asking questions about our bay.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="defensive">I'm conducting research. The marine life here shows signs of contamination that—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Research.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor's voice cuts through Sarah's explanation like a blade through silk. The older woman takes another step closer, and Sarah fights the urge to back away. There's something predatory in Eleanor's stillness, the way she seems to be measuring Sarah's every word and gesture.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Tell me, Miss Chen, what brought you to Millbrook specifically? Surely there are other coastal towns that would serve your... research purposes.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The question hangs in the salt air like a challenge. Sarah feels heat rise in her cheeks, though she's not entirely sure why. There's something about the way Eleanor asks—as if she already knows the answer, as if she's testing Sarah rather than seeking information. Margaret shifts uncomfortably beside them, and Thomas clears his throat, the sound rough as barnacles on wood.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="uncomfortable">Fog's lifting. Should be getting the boats ready.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="sharp">The boats can wait, Thomas.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor doesn't take her eyes off Sarah, and the dismissal in her voice makes Thomas flinch visibly. Sarah realizes she's witnessing a display of power, a reminder of hierarchies she doesn't yet understand. The notebook in her hands feels suddenly fragile, her weeks of careful documentation meaningless against whatever force Eleanor Cross represents.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="uncertain">I chose Millbrook because of the reports. The unusual marine deaths, the patterns in the—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>What patterns?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>There's something dangerous in Eleanor's sudden stillness. Sarah glances at Margaret, looking for support, but finds only carefully blank professionalism. The morning light catches the silver in Eleanor's hair, and again Sarah has that strange sense of recognition, as if she's looking at a photograph she can't quite place.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>The fish, the seals—they're showing signs of exposure to industrial waste. But there's something else, something I can't identify yet. The cellular damage is unlike anything I've seen in my studies.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="nervous">Miss Chen has been very thorough in her documentation.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="cold">I'm sure she has.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor's gaze never leaves Sarah's face, and the weight of that scrutiny is becoming unbearable. Sarah feels exposed, as if this woman can see through her professional credentials to something deeper, something Sarah herself doesn't fully understand. The fog continues to lift, revealing more of the bay's dark water, and with it comes a growing sense that this conversation is about far more than marine biology.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>Tell me, Miss Chen—do you have family in this area? Any... connection to Millbrook that might not be immediately obvious?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The question hits Sarah like a physical blow. Her grip tightens on her notebook, and she feels her heart begin to race. There's something in Eleanor's tone that suggests she already knows the answer, that this entire encounter has been leading to this moment. Sarah's mind races through fragments of memory—her grandmother's old letters, the mysterious gaps in family stories, the strange pull she'd felt toward this particular stretch of coast.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="shaken">I... no, I don't think so. Why would you ask that?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="knowing">Because sometimes the past has a way of calling us home, Miss Chen. Even when we don't remember the way.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>
