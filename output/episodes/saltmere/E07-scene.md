<VOICE:NARRATOR>The evening fog rolls in from the bay, wrapping around the weathered pilings like secrets refusing to surface. Margaret stands at the end of the dock, the manila envelope in her hands feeling heavier than it should. Sarah's research findings—water samples, photographs, documentation of the contamination patterns. Everything points to what Margaret has tried so hard to forget, what her father made her promise never to speak of. The old families' sins, buried beneath decades of silence and salt water. Her hands tremble as footsteps approach on the dock behind her.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Margaret? I saw you from the road. You look like you've seen a ghost.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret turns, clutching the envelope closer to her chest. Sarah's earnest face, so much like her grandmother's in the old newspaper clippings Margaret found in her father's papers. The marine biologist who came asking questions forty years ago and simply... disappeared. The weight of that knowledge sits like a stone in Margaret's throat.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="strained">Just thinking about your findings, dear. About what they might mean for the town.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="concerned">The contamination patterns are worse than I initially thought. Whatever was dumped out there, it's been leaching into the ecosystem for decades. The tissue samples from the dead seals show traces of industrial chemicals, but also... other things.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret's breath catches. Other things. She knows exactly what other things Sarah has found, even if the young woman doesn't understand their significance yet. The sound of heavy boots on the dock announces Thomas's arrival, his weathered face grim in the dying light.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>Evening, ladies. Word's getting around about these water tests. Some folks aren't happy about outside attention being drawn to our bay.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="defensive">I'm just documenting what's here, Mr. Breck. The truth doesn't change because people don't want to hear it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret watches Thomas's jaw tighten, recognizes the protective instinct she's felt her whole life. But protection for whom? The town? The families? Or the secrets themselves? She thinks of her father on his deathbed, gripping her hand, making her swear to keep the old promises. But looking at Sarah now, so determined and innocent, Margaret feels those promises cracking like ice in spring.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="warning">Some truths are better left buried, Miss Chen. This town has weathered plenty of storms by knowing when to look forward instead of back.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>How very philosophical of you, Thomas.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Eleanor Cross materializes from the fog like a specter of authority, her silver hair perfectly coiffed despite the dampness, her presence commanding immediate attention. Margaret feels herself straightening automatically, the old deference bred into her bones. Eleanor's eyes find the envelope in Margaret's hands, and something cold and knowing passes between them.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="measured">I trust we're all having a productive evening discussion about Miss Chen's... research.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>Mrs. Cross, I was hoping to speak with you. Your family has deep roots here. You might have historical context for what I'm finding in the bay.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret watches Eleanor's face remain perfectly composed, but she knows that look—has seen it in town meetings when inconvenient questions arise. The envelope in her hands seems to pulse with its own weight. Inside are her father's notes, his maps marking the dump sites, his letters coordinating with the other families. Evidence that Eleanor Cross didn't just know about the contamination—she helped orchestrate the cover-up.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>History, my dear, is often a matter of perspective. What seems significant to an outsider may simply be the natural course of a working waterfront.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="frustrated">Natural? The chemical signatures in these samples don't occur naturally. Someone deliberately dumped industrial waste, possibly for decades. The ecosystem damage is extensive.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="quiet">Sarah... what if the damage goes deeper than just industrial waste?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The words escape before Margaret can stop them. Three faces turn toward her, but it's Eleanor's sharp attention that cuts deepest. Margaret feels the weight of three generations of silence pressing down on her shoulders, but Sarah's earnest determination pulls at something deeper—a need for truth that her father's death has finally set free.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="sharp">Margaret.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor tone="warning">Mrs. Holloway, perhaps the evening air is making you melancholy. Sometimes grief can make us say things we don't mean.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Eleanor>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>But Margaret is looking at Sarah, seeing not just the young marine biologist, but the ghost of her grandmother—the woman who asked the right questions forty years ago and paid the price. The envelope crinkles in her tightening grip as she realizes the moment of choice has arrived. Keep her father's promise and let the lies continue, or break the silence that has protected the powerful while poisoning everything else.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="resolute">My father kept detailed records, Eleanor. Of everything. Including what really happened to that marine biologist who came here in 1912.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The silence that follows is deafening, broken only by the lap of contaminated waves against the dock. Eleanor's composed mask slips for just an instant, revealing something predatory underneath. Thomas steps closer, his loyalty clearly torn between old friendships and older secrets. And Sarah stares at Margaret with growing comprehension, her grandmother's fate finally taking shape in the gathering darkness.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="whisper">1912? My grandmother came here in 1912...</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>
