# What the Tide Brought Back

**Episode 8** | **Series**: Saltmere Chronicles | **POV**: Thomas Breck

---

## COLD OPEN

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The net felt wrong before Thomas even started hauling it in. [pause] Forty years on these waters, and a man learns to read weight like a fortune teller reads palms. Too heavy for fish. Too still for anything living. His hands kept pulling anyway—muscle memory older than thought—while his mind was already composing the lie he'd have to tell Margaret.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Dawn painted the sky the color of a fresh bruise. The *Mary Ellen* rocked gently, her hull creaking the same complaints his father's boat had made, and his grandfather's before that. Three generations of Brecks pulling secrets from this bay. [long pause] He'd always known, somehow, that one day the bay would pull something back.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

## ACT I

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The thing in his net wasn't a body. That was the first relief, washing through him like the morning cold. But what it was—that was harder to name. A metal cylinder, maybe two feet long, crusted with decades of marine growth. Barnacles and rust had made it nearly unrecognizable, but Thomas knew military ordinance when he saw it. His uncle had shown him enough photographs after Korea.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He set it down on the deck with the careful reverence of a man handling a sleeping rattlesnake. The cylinder bore markings, half-eaten by salt and time, but one word remained legible: PROPERTY. [pause] And below it, a serial number that meant nothing to him but would mean everything to someone.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="muttering">Dammit, Pop. What did you get us into?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>His father had never talked about the old days. The cannery days. When Saltmere had been something more than a dying fishing village clinging to the edge of the continent. Thomas had been too young to remember the prosperity, but he remembered the silence that came after—the way the old-timers would stop talking when children walked by, the way his father's eyes would go distant whenever anyone mentioned the bay's deeper waters.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The radio crackled. Margaret's voice, clipped and professional, running through the morning's harbor report. Thomas reached for the receiver, then stopped. [pause] His hand hovered there, caught between loyalty and something that felt uncomfortably like self-preservation.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret was harbor master now, same as her father had been. Same as her father had been when the dumping was happening. If this cylinder was what he thought it was—what the pattern of strange fish deaths and Sarah Chen's concerned frowns suggested it might be—then calling Margaret meant pulling her into something her own family had helped bury.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="weary">Childhood friends. [pause] Funny how that works. Forty years of shared history, and I still don't know if I can trust her with this.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He covered the cylinder with a tarp and pointed the *Mary Ellen* toward shore. The smart thing—the pragmatic thing—would be to drop it back in the water and forget he'd ever seen it. Let the bay keep its secrets for another generation. But Thomas had never been smart, only stubborn. And somewhere in the back of his mind, he could hear Sarah Chen's voice asking about the unusual chemical readings in the water samples.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The newcomer. The scientist. The one asking all the questions that made the old families nervous. [pause] Maybe it was time someone started giving her answers.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

## ACT II

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The research station sat at the edge of town like an afterthought, a prefab building that the university had dropped on the shore and promptly forgotten about. Sarah's truck was parked outside, already mud-splattered despite the early hour. The woman worked like she was running out of time—or running from something. Thomas understood that particular kind of drive better than he'd ever admit.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He killed the engine and sat there for a long moment, the cylinder wrapped in canvas on the seat beside him. Through the station's window, he could see Sarah bent over her equipment, dark hair escaping from a hasty ponytail. She looked up at the sound of his truck, and something flickered across her face—surprise, then wariness, then a careful neutral expression that told him she'd already learned not to trust too quickly in Saltmere.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="cautious">Thomas. You're early. I wasn't expecting the samples until—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="gruff">Didn't bring samples.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He set the wrapped cylinder on her examination table, and something in the way she looked at it—that sharp, focused attention—reminded him painfully of his daughter before she'd left for Seattle and stopped returning his calls. Scientists, he thought. They all had that same hunger for truth, regardless of what it might cost.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="measured">Pulled this up about two miles offshore. The deep channel, where my grandfather used to say the fishing was best. [pause] Hasn't been true for thirty years now.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sarah's hands were steady as she unwrapped the canvas. He watched her face, waiting for the recognition, the horror. Instead, he saw something worse: confirmation. Her shoulders dropped slightly, the tension of suspicion giving way to the heavier weight of certainty.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="quiet">I knew it. [pause] I knew there had to be a point source. The dispersal pattern didn't make sense otherwise.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="confused">You knew? About this?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="intense">Not specifically. But the bioaccumulation data, the sediment samples—something's been leaching into the bay for decades. Heavy metals, industrial compounds. [pause] The kind of thing you'd find in old military surplus. Or industrial waste from the cannery era.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>She was already photographing the cylinder, documenting it with the methodical care of someone building a case. Thomas felt the floor shift beneath him, though the building was perfectly still. He'd come here looking for answers, and instead he'd handed this stranger the key to every skeleton his family had ever buried.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="worried">Sarah. [long pause] Before you go any further with this, you need to understand something. The old families—my family, Margaret's family, the Crosses—we're all tangled up in whatever happened back then. If you start pulling at this thread, the whole town's going to come apart.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="firm">People are sick, Thomas. The marine die-offs are getting worse every year. [pause] How many more generations are supposed to pay for whatever your fathers and grandfathers dumped in that water?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He didn't have an answer for that. The weight of it sat in his chest like a stone, the same weight his father must have carried, and his father before him. The price of loyalty, paid forward in silence and complicity.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>But something else was nagging at him. Something in the way Sarah had said "your fathers and grandfathers." Like she was setting herself apart from it. Like she had no stake in the old secrets. [pause] Except Eleanor Cross had been watching this woman since the day she arrived, with that knowing look the matriarch reserved for people who didn't know their own history.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="probing">Can I ask you something? [pause] Why Saltmere? Of all the coastal research sites you could've picked, why here?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sarah's hands stilled on the cylinder. Just for a moment, just a flicker, but Thomas had spent his life reading the small movements of things—the twitch of a fish on a line, the shift of the wind before a storm. This woman was hiding something too.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="deflecting">The university assigned me. Random selection from a list of potential sites.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="skeptical">Random. [pause] That's funny. Because Eleanor Cross seems to think otherwise. And that woman doesn't speculate about anything she doesn't already know.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The silence stretched between them, filled with the hum of Sarah's equipment and the distant cry of gulls. Thomas watched her face, saw the war between truth and self-protection playing out behind her eyes. It was a war he'd fought himself, every time someone asked about the things he'd pulled from his nets and thrown back without reporting.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="resigned">My grandmother. [long pause] She was a researcher too. Came here in the sixties to study the same things I'm studying now. [pause] She never came back.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The stone in Thomas's chest grew heavier. The sixties. The same years the dumping would have been at its peak. The same years the old-timers went silent about.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="grave">Sarah. What was your grandmother's name?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="quiet">Liu. Dr. Helen Liu.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The name hit him like a rogue wave. He'd heard it before, whispered in the same breath as the old cannery and the things that were buried there. His father, drunk on his sixty-fifth birthday, muttering about the scientist who'd asked too many questions. The one who'd found something she shouldn't have. [pause] The one who'd disappeared.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

## ACT III

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Thomas gripped the edge of the examination table, steadying himself against a truth forty years in the making. Outside, the fog was rolling in, softening the edges of the world the way it always did when Saltmere had something to hide.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="shaken">You didn't come here to study marine biology. [pause] You came here to find out what happened to her.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="defensive">I came here to do both. The science is real, Thomas. The contamination is real. Whatever killed those seals and poisoned this bay—it's getting worse, and it's going to keep getting worse unless someone does something about it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="urgent">And what happens when you dig deep enough to find out your grandmother didn't just disappear? What happens when you find out that the same people who dumped that poison in the water might have—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He stopped himself. But it was too late. He could see in Sarah's eyes that she'd already followed his words to their conclusion. The color drained from her face, leaving behind something hard and cold and utterly determined.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="steel">Might have what, Thomas? [pause] Say it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The words wouldn't come. Forty years of silence, bred into his bones, sealed his throat. But his face must have said enough, because Sarah turned away, her hands trembling as she began gathering her documentation into a folder.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="cold">I need you to leave now. I have calls to make.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="pleading">Sarah, wait. You can't just—the EPA, the authorities—you don't know what you're stirring up. These aren't just old men protecting their reputations. Some of them are still powerful. Some of them are still dangerous.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="bitter">And some of them are your friends. [pause] I understand, Thomas. You've been carrying water for these people your whole life. You don't know how to stop.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The accusation stung because it was true. He stood there, useless and complicit, watching her prepare to tear down everything his family had built on this coast. And the worst part—the part that kept him rooted to the floor instead of walking out—was that she was right to do it.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="quiet">There's a file. [long pause] In the old cannery. My father told me about it once, when he thought he was dying. Said there was documentation—manifests, permits, everything they needed to prove what was dumped and when. [pause] He said they kept it as insurance, in case anyone ever tried to pin the blame on just one family.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sarah turned back, her expression unreadable.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="wary">Why are you telling me this?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="resigned">Because I'm tired. [pause] Forty years of keeping secrets for people who never asked if I wanted to carry them. Forty years of watching this bay die by inches. [long pause] And because if something happened to your grandmother in this town, you deserve to know who was responsible.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The fog pressed against the windows, thickening. Somewhere out on the water, a boat horn sounded—probably Margaret, making her morning rounds, unaware that the ground was about to shift beneath all of them.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah tone="measured">The cannery's been locked for thirty years. Eleanor Cross holds the only key.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sarah>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas tone="grim">I know. [pause] That's the problem.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Thomas>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He left her there with the cylinder and the truth, walking out into the fog toward his truck. The *Mary Ellen* was still tied at the dock, waiting to take him back out to waters that had been poisoned before he was born. But for the first time in his life, Thomas Breck wasn't sure he could keep pretending not to see what lay beneath the surface.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>His phone buzzed. A text from Margaret: *Coffee at the usual spot? Need to talk about the development permits.*</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>He stared at the message for a long moment. Then he typed back: *Can't today. Something came up.*</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The first lie he'd ever told Margaret Holloway. [long pause] He had a feeling it wouldn't be the last.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
