<VOICE:NARRATOR>The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Sheriff Donovan's office, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Jack Morrison shifted uncomfortably in the hard chair, his palms damp with perspiration despite the October chill seeping through the walls. The filing cabinets loomed around them like silent witnesses, stuffed with cold cases and forgotten mysteries. He could hear the tick of the wall clock marking each second, each moment he hadn't spoken up. Margaret Holloway sat primly beside him, her teacher's posture perfect even in this cramped, intimidating space. Across from them, Old Pete Anderson slouched in his chair, weathered hands clasped tightly in his lap. Sheriff Donovan paced behind his desk like a caged animal, and Jack couldn't shake the feeling that they were all here for a reason none of them fully understood yet.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="authoritative">I appreciate you all coming in today. I know it's been difficult for everyone since the mill fire, but some new information has come to light that requires clarification.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Jack's heart hammered against his ribs. New information. The words echoed in his mind as he tried to keep his expression neutral. He glanced sideways at Margaret, noting the slight tightening around her eyes, then at Pete, whose face remained impassive as carved stone. What did they know? What did any of them know about that terrible night three years ago?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="cautious">What kind of information, Sheriff? I thought the investigation was closed. The report said faulty wiring.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>That's what we all believed, Mrs. Holloway. But when they started clearing the land for the new development, they found some... inconsistencies.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Jack's mouth went dry. Inconsistencies. He forced himself to breathe slowly, to maintain the facade of a concerned newcomer who'd only arrived in Millbrook six months ago. But inside, memories clawed at him—memories of smoke and screaming, of a face he'd loved disappearing into the flames. He had to know what they'd found, but he couldn't ask without revealing too much interest.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="gruff">What kind of inconsistencies? I was there that night, Sheriff. Saw the whole damn thing go up.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="suspicious">That's exactly why I need to talk to you, Pete. Your statement from that night mentions seeing someone near the mill just before the fire started. Someone you couldn't identify in the dark.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The air in the room seemed to thicken. Jack felt Margaret's sharp gaze flick toward him, then back to Pete. Did she suspect something? His ambitious plans for establishing himself in this town suddenly felt foolish, insignificant compared to the weight of the secret he carried. He'd come to Millbrook to start over, to build something new, but the past was rising from the ashes whether he wanted it to or not.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="reluctant">It was dark, Sheriff. Could've been anyone. Could've been a shadow for all I know.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>Pete, if you saw something, you need to tell the truth. Seventeen people died in that fire.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Seventeen people. Jack knew that number by heart—had seen it in every newspaper, heard it in every whispered conversation since he'd arrived. But for him, it wasn't just a statistic. It was Emma's laugh cut short, Emma's dreams reduced to ash. He shifted in his chair, the leather creaking under him, and caught Sheriff Donovan's sharp eyes studying his reaction.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="probing">Mr. Morrison, I know you're new to town, but you've been asking quite a few questions about the fire since you arrived. Mind telling us why you're so interested in ancient history?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The moment Jack had been dreading was here. He could feel all their eyes on him—Margaret's schoolteacher scrutiny, Pete's weathered suspicion, the Sheriff's professional assessment. His carefully constructed cover story felt paper-thin suddenly. He was just a businessman looking for opportunities, he'd told everyone. Just a stranger drawn to a town in need of rebuilding. But now, faced with their expectant faces, the lie tasted bitter in his mouth.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">I... well, I suppose I was trying to understand what happened. You can't rebuild something properly without understanding why it fell down in the first place, right?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="precise">That's a very philosophical approach to property development, Mr. Morrison.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The skepticism in her voice cut deep. Jack realized he was at a crossroads—continue the charade and risk everything unraveling anyway, or take the leap into honesty that might destroy him but could finally free him from the crushing weight of his secret. The tick of the clock seemed to grow louder, marking time like a countdown to a decision that would change everything.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Pete, I need you to think harder about what you saw that night. And Mr. Morrison, I get the feeling there's more to your interest in this town than business opportunities.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Jack's hands trembled slightly as he gripped the arms of his chair. The truth sat like a stone in his throat, heavy and jagged. Emma Patterson had been more than just another victim to him—she'd been everything. And he'd been supposed to meet her that night, supposed to be there when the fire started. The guilt and the love and the desperate need for answers had driven him here, to this moment, to this choice between the safety of lies and the terrifying possibility of justice.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="conflicted">Sheriff, there's something I need to tell you all. Something I should have said the day I arrived in Millbrook...</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>
