<VOICE:NARRATOR>The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty venetian blinds of Sheriff Donovan's office, casting prison-bar shadows across the worn wooden floor. I stood near the filing cabinets, my palms sweating as I watched the sheriff shuffle through a stack of yellowed papers. The smell of old coffee and cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, mixing with something else—the musty scent of secrets long buried. My heart hammered against my ribs. When Sheriff Donovan had asked me to come in for a "chat" about the mill fire, I'd known this day would eventually come. I just hadn't expected it to feel like standing on the edge of a cliff.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="measured">Jack, I appreciate you coming in on such short notice. Please, have a seat.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>I eased into the creaky wooden chair across from his desk, trying to keep my hands steady. Through the window, I could see Margaret Holloway approaching the office, her schoolteacher's posture rigid with purpose. Behind her, Old Pete Anderson shuffled along, his weathered face grim. My stomach dropped. This wasn't going to be just a casual conversation.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">Of course, Sheriff. Though I'm not sure what I can tell you about the mill that hasn't already been said.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>That's what we're here to find out.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The door opened with a sharp creak, and Margaret stepped inside, followed by Pete. She nodded curtly at me, her keen eyes already assessing the situation. Pete removed his cap, his gnarled fingers working the brim nervously. The small office suddenly felt suffocating with all of us crammed inside. I could feel their eyes on me, and the weight of my secret pressed down like a stone in my chest.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="precise">Sheriff Donovan, you said you had new information about the mill fire?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="authoritative">I do. Pete here came to see me this morning. Seems he's been carrying around some guilt about that night. Pete?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Old Pete shifted uncomfortably, his rheumy eyes darting between us. I found myself leaning forward despite my fear, desperate to hear what he knew. Had someone seen me that night? Had someone seen her?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="reluctant">Well, I... I reckon I should've spoken up sooner. Night of the fire, I was coming home late from Henderson's place. Saw someone near the mill 'bout an hour before the flames started.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="careful">Someone? Who?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The question slipped out before I could stop it. Pete's weathered face turned toward me, and I felt exposed, like he could see right through to my racing heart. Margaret was watching me too, those sharp teacher's eyes missing nothing. I forced myself to sit back, to breathe normally, but my collar felt too tight.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>Couldn't make out much in the dark. But it was a woman, I'm sure of that. Moving real purposeful-like around the back of the building.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="curious">A woman? Pete, why didn't you mention this during the investigation?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="defensive">Didn't want to point fingers without being certain. Besides, could've been anyone—someone taking a shortcut home, or...</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>His voice trailed off, but I could feel the unspoken weight of his suspicion. My throat felt dry as desert sand. He was describing her—I knew it with every fiber of my being. She'd been there that night, just like she'd said. But what Pete didn't know, what none of them knew, was why she'd been there. Or what she'd been running from when I found her afterward, tears streaming down her face, her clothes smelling of smoke.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="pressing">Pete, I need you to think carefully. Was there anything else? Anything distinctive about this woman?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="strained">Sheriff, surely you don't think someone deliberately set the fire? The official report said faulty wiring.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret's head snapped toward me, and I realized my mistake immediately. I'd sounded too eager to dismiss the possibility, too quick to defend the official story. In a town like Millbrook, where everyone knew everyone else's business, showing too much interest in steering a conversation was as good as painting a target on your back.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="sharp">Jack, you seem awfully concerned about protecting the official version of events.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="hasty">Not protecting anything. I just think we should be careful about wild accusations. That fire destroyed lives—people's livelihoods, their futures. Turning it into some kind of conspiracy doesn't help anyone.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The silence that followed was deafening. Sheriff Donovan leaned back in his chair, studying me with those cop eyes that had probably seen through a thousand lies. Pete was still turning his cap in his hands, but now he was watching me too. And Margaret—she had that look she probably gave students who were caught cheating, like she was adding up all the small inconsistencies and arriving at an uncomfortable truth.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="suspicious">Funny thing, Jack. For someone who's only lived here eight months, you sure seem to have strong feelings about how that investigation should be handled.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>My mouth went completely dry. Eight months. He knew exactly when I'd arrived—right after the fire. Right after I'd helped her disappear. The walls of the small office seemed to be closing in, and I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. Everything was unraveling, just like I'd always known it would.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="thoughtful">Now that you mention it, Sheriff... there was something else about that woman I saw. She was carrying something—looked like a small suitcase or bag.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="desperate">Pete, it was dark, you said so yourself. How can you be sure of these details now?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The desperation in my voice was unmistakable now. I could hear it myself, that thin edge of panic that meant I was losing control of the situation. Margaret and the Sheriff exchanged a look—one of those wordless communications that happen between people who've known each other for years. My secret felt like it was burning a hole right through my chest.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="commanding">Jack, I think it's time you told us why you're really so interested in keeping the past buried.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>
