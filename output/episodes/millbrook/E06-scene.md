<VOICE:NARRATOR>The afternoon light filtered through the grimy windows of the sheriff's office, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Frank Donovan sat behind his desk, pretending to review incident reports, but his mind kept drifting to the questions that had been plaguing him for weeks. The stack of files about people leaving town seemed to grow thicker each day, and something about the pattern didn't sit right. The familiar creak of the front door made him look up, his hand instinctively moving closer to his service weapon. In his twenty years wearing the badge, unexpected visitors rarely brought good news.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="cautious">Sheriff Donovan? I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Miss Holloway. Not at all. What brings you by the office today?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret Holloway stepped into the office with her usual measured precision, but Frank noticed the tension in her shoulders, the way she clutched her handbag a little too tightly. As the town's longtime schoolteacher, Margaret rarely showed uncertainty, but something had clearly shaken her usual composure. Frank's suspicious nature immediately went on alert – in his experience, when solid citizens started acting nervous, it usually meant trouble was brewing.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>There's been a man asking questions around town. About the old mill fire. Jack Morrison – says he's from some development company.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="guarded">What kind of questions?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Frank's stomach tightened. The mill fire. Even five years later, the mention of it made his chest feel heavy with the weight of things left unsaid. He kept his expression neutral, but his mind was already racing. Why would a development company be interested in ancient history? And why did the timing feel so wrong, coming right after all these mysterious departures from town?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>Technical questions about the electrical systems, the official report. But also... more personal things. About who was there that night, who might have seen something unusual.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete tone="gruff">That'd be me he's been pestering about.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Frank hadn't heard Pete Anderson approach – the old man moved quieter than anyone had a right to at his age. Pete's weathered face bore the same reluctant expression Frank had seen countless times when the man was forced to interact with authority. But there was something else there too, a wariness that made Frank's instincts sharpen. Pete had been at the mill that night, one of the last to leave before the fire started. If someone was asking him questions...</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Pete. What exactly did this Morrison fellow want to know?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>Kept asking about the timeline. When I left, when I saw the first smoke. Whether the electrical work looked up to code.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause any concern.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Frank's head snapped toward the voice. A thin man in an ill-fitting suit stood in the doorway, shifting his weight from foot to foot like a man trying to decide whether to run. Jack Morrison, presumably. Frank had dealt with enough nervous suspects to recognize the type – ambitious enough to get in over his head, but not smart enough to handle the consequences. The question was: what consequences was Morrison worried about?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="authoritative">Mr. Morrison, I presume. You want to explain why you're asking questions about official business without talking to me first?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="defensive">It's just routine due diligence, Sheriff. My company is considering some development proposals in the area. We need to understand any potential... complications.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="sharp">Complications? That fire destroyed this town's livelihood. Calling it a 'complication' seems rather callous.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Frank watched Morrison's face carefully as Margaret spoke. The man's eyes darted between the three of them, calculating something. Frank had seen that look before – usually right before someone decided to either come clean or double down on their lies. The weight of his own secrets about that night pressed against his chest like a stone. If Morrison kept digging, kept asking the right questions to the right people, how long before the truth came out? And what would that mean for everyone involved?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>Look, I understand this is sensitive. But there are some... inconsistencies in the official report that my investors need clarified.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="cold">What kind of inconsistencies?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="reluctant">The electrical inspection records don't match the timeline in your report, Sheriff. And there are insurance documents that suggest—</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete tone="warning">Boy, you might want to think real careful about what you're suggesting.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. Frank could see Morrison realizing he'd stepped into something much deeper than a simple development deal. The man's ambition was warring with his growing fear, and Frank knew from experience that scared people made unpredictable choices. But what scared Frank more was the possibility that Morrison might actually be onto something – something that could unravel everything Frank had worked to keep buried since that night five years ago.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="firm">Perhaps, Mr. Morrison, you should discuss your concerns with the appropriate authorities before involving the whole town in your... investigation.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Miss Holloway's right. My office handles official inquiries. You have questions about that fire, you bring them to me. Directly.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">Of course, Sheriff. I didn't mean to overstep. Perhaps we could schedule a formal meeting?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Frank nodded slowly, his mind already working through the implications. Morrison clearly knew more than he was saying, but so did everyone else in this room. The question was whether the truth about that night would help anyone, or if it would just destroy what little was left of Millbrook. As he looked at Margaret's concerned face and Pete's guarded expression, Frank realized that his carefully maintained secrets might be about to collide with forces beyond his control. The mill fire had taken the town's economic heart five years ago – but the aftermath might be about to claim what remained of its soul.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
