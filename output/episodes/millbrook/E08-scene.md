<VOICE:NARRATOR>The wood-paneled walls of Sheriff Donovan's office seemed to close in on me as I sat in the hard wooden chair, my weathered hands clasped tight in my lap. Thirty years of keeping quiet, and now here I was, called in like some common criminal. The filing cabinets loomed around us, stuffed with papers and secrets, just like the one eating away at my gut. I could smell the old coffee brewing on the hot plate, mixed with the scent of dust and regret that seemed to cling to everything in this room.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="authoritative">Pete, I appreciate you coming in today. I know this isn't easy, talking about the night of the mill fire again.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete tone="cautious">Been a long time, Frank. Thought we'd put all that business to bed.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret Holloway sat primly in the corner, her teacher's posture straight as a ruler, taking notes like she always did. That woman never missed a detail. Jack Morrison fidgeted by the window, newer to town than the rest of us, but somehow caught up in all this mess. The way his hands shook when he lit his cigarette told me he knew more than he was letting on.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="precise">The official report stated faulty wiring, Pete. But there have been... questions raised recently. New evidence has come to light during the development planning.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>New evidence? What kind of evidence?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged bird. After all these years, what could they have found? I watched Jack's reflection in the window glass, saw him tense up at Margaret's words. There was something about that boy that didn't sit right with me.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">Maybe we should leave the past alone. People have moved on, built new lives. What good does it do, digging all this up?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="suspicious">That's an interesting perspective, Jack. Especially from someone who wasn't even here when it happened.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>Frank's right to ask questions. That fire... it changed everything for this town. Took away folks' livelihoods, sent families packing.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The words tasted like ash in my mouth. I'd seen those flames dance that night, seen who struck the match, and I'd carried that burden ever since. But saying it out loud... that would destroy more than just one life. The weight of it pressed down on my shoulders like a millstone.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="moral">Pete, you were one of the last people to leave the mill that evening. Your testimony was crucial to the investigation then. I'm wondering if there's anything else you might remember now, with time to reflect?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete tone="reluctant">Memory's a funny thing, Margaret. Sometimes it plays tricks on an old man.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="conflicted">Pete's right. Memory fades. People see things that weren't there, or think they see things... stress of a situation like that.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Now why was Jack so eager to plant doubt about what I might have seen? The way he kept glancing at the door, like a rabbit ready to bolt, made my gut churn. There was fear in his eyes, the kind of fear that comes from knowing your secrets are about to spill into the light.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>Pete, I need you to think carefully. Was there anyone else around the mill that night? Anyone who might not have been in the official reports?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete tone="weathered">There were shadows, Frank. Lots of shadows that night.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>I felt Margaret's sharp gaze boring into me, those schoolteacher instincts telling her I was dancing around the truth. Jack had gone pale as winter milk, his cigarette forgotten between his fingers. The silence stretched out between us like a taut wire, ready to snap. They all wanted the truth, but the truth was a weapon that would cut deep into this town's heart. Some wounds, once opened, never heal right.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="precise">Pete, the future of Millbrook might depend on what really happened that night. Development plans, insurance settlements, people's faith in their community. Don't you think they deserve to know?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>Some truths are heavier than others, Margaret. Heavy enough to crush what's left of a place trying to rebuild.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Old_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The old wound in my chest opened up again, raw as the day it happened. Jack Morrison stood there shaking, and I wondered if he was connected to all this somehow, or if he just had the misfortune to be here when the past came knocking. Either way, the reckoning was coming, and there wasn't a damn thing any of us could do to stop it.</VOICE:NARRATOR>
