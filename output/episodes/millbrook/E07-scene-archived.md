<VOICE:NARRATOR>The late afternoon light filtered through the dusty windows of Sheriff Donovan's office, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Margaret Holloway sat rigidly in the uncomfortable chair across from his desk, her hands folded tightly in her lap to stop them from trembling. The manila folder she'd brought lay between them like an accusation. She'd rehearsed this moment a dozen times on the walk over, but now that she was here, the words felt like stones in her throat. How do you tell a man that everything he believes about his town might be built on lies?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="concerned">You sounded urgent on the telephone, Margaret. What's got you so worked up?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="cautious">Frank, I... I found something. About the mill fire. I wish I hadn't, but I did.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Sheriff Donovan's expression shifted, the casual friendliness draining from his weathered features. Margaret watched him lean back in his chair, and she could practically see the walls going up. She'd known Frank for fifteen years, had watched him handle everything from barn fires to boundary disputes with steady competence. But this was different. This cut to the heart of everything.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="wary">What kind of something?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>Papers. Hidden in the school's old storage room. I was cleaning out files for the new superintendent when I found them tucked behind some old textbooks.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>The door creaked open, and Pete Anderson shuffled in without knocking. Margaret's heart sank. Pete had a way of being everywhere important conversations were happening, and his presence would complicate everything. The old man's rheumy eyes took in the scene with surprising sharpness - the folder, Margaret's pale face, the sheriff's defensive posture.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="gruff">Afternoon, folks. Heard there might be talk about the old mill.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="irritated">Pete, this is official business.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>More official than the truth? Because that's what the lady's got there, isn't it? Been wondering when someone would find those papers.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret's breath caught. Pete knew? She studied his weathered face, looking for answers in the deep lines around his eyes. The weight of her discovery suddenly felt heavier, more real. If Pete knew about the papers, if he'd been carrying this knowledge all these years... How many others were there? How many people in Millbrook were walking around with pieces of this puzzle?</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="shocked">You knew about these?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>Knew there were things that didn't add up about that fire. Saw things that night that never made it into any official report.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Before anyone could respond, Jack Morrison appeared in the doorway, his usually neat appearance disheveled, his tie askew. Margaret noticed the way his eyes immediately went to the folder on Donovan's desk, and something cold settled in her stomach. Jack was new to town, had only arrived a few months ago, but he was looking at those papers like he knew exactly what they contained.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="nervous">Sheriff, I... I need to speak with you about...</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="suspicious">About what, Jack?</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack tone="conflicted">The mill. The fire. There are things... things I should have told you when I first came to town.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Jack>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret felt the room shift around her, the air growing thick with unspoken truths. She'd come here thinking she was bringing new information, evidence that would finally shed light on the tragedy that had destroyed their town's heart. Instead, she was sitting in the middle of a web of secrets that seemed to touch everyone. Her teacher's instincts kicked in - the same ones that told her when a student was lying about homework or when there was trouble brewing in the hallway. Something was very, very wrong here.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="firm">I think we all need to put our cards on the table. Right now.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete tone="reluctant">Some cards been face down a long time, miss. Might not be safe to flip 'em over.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Pete>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff tone="authoritative">Safe or not, if there's information about the mill fire that I don't have, I need to hear it. All of it.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Sheriff>

<VOICE:NARRATOR>Margaret opened the folder with hands that barely shook now. Decision made, there was only the truth left to tell. But as she looked around the room at these three men - one she'd trusted for years, one she barely knew, and one who apparently knew more than he'd ever let on - she realized that the truth might be more dangerous than the lies that had been protecting it. The papers in her hands weren't just evidence of what had happened that night at the mill. They were proof that someone had been very careful to make sure the real story never came to light. And now, in this small office with shadows growing longer by the minute, she was about to find out who.</VOICE:NARRATOR>

<VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret tone="resolute">The mill fire wasn't an accident, Frank. And according to these insurance documents... someone made a lot of money making sure it looked like one.</VOICE:CHARACTER_Margaret>
