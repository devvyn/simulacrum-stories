  "text": " The fog came in like a slow exhalation, the kind that didn't lift so much as thin, retreating grudgingly toward the tree line by mid-morning only to thicken again by four. Sarah Chen had read about Pacific Northwest coastal fog in the Survey Literature. Advaction fog, the meteorologists called it, warm air meeting cold water. But the clinical terminology hadn't prepared her for the way it erased the world in layers, dissolving first the horizon, then the far shore, then finally the end of the dock, until she stood in a grey room with no walls and no ceiling, only the slap of water against pilings to remind her which way was down. She derived three hours early, a habit from graduate school that had calcified into compulsion. Reach the field site before anyone expects you, walk the perimeter, take samples no one asked for. Her advisor had called it thoroughness, her ex-husband had called it avoidance. Sarah preferred not to call it anything at all. The research station was smaller than the photographs had suggested, a prefab rectangle squatting at the end of a gravel access road. Its aluminum siding already streaked with salt corrosion despite being only six years old. The university had built it for a kelp restoration project that lost funding after two seasons. Now it served as overflow housing for visiting researchers, the kind of place that accumulated in the budget lines of grant proposals, field station, Pacific Northwest, zero dollars, in kind contribution. Sarah had written those words herself, knowing even then that she was lying about the cost. She unlocked the door with the key the department secretary had mailed her, no instructions, no contact number, just the key in an envelope as if that were explanation enough and stepped into the smell of mildew and disuse, a single room divided by a lab bench, sleeping quarters on one side, workspace on the other, a camp stove, a mini fridge that harmed arthritically, a window facing the water, though at the moment the water was only a theory hidden behind curtains of gray. Sarah set her duffel on the narrow bed and her equipment cases on the lab bench, each in its designated spot, and then she stood in the center of the room with her hands at her sides breathing. She told herself this was a professional opportunity. The contamination readings from Saltmeer Bay had been anomalous for years, heavy metals and industrial compounds in concentrations that didn't match any known source, a puzzle that had nought at the edges of three different EPA reports without ever becoming anyone's priority. When the grant came through, she presented it to her department as a chance to publish something significant. Career advancement she'd written in her proposal narrative, contribution to the field. She hadn't mentioned her grandmother's name. The knock came at 11 when the fog had thinned enough to reveal the outline of the dock and the dark suggestion of boats moored beyond it. Sarah opened the door to find a man in his 50s holding a cardboard box, his face weathered to the color of old rope, salt and pepper stubble climbing his jaw like lichen on stone. Supplies, he said, Margaret sent me. He didn't offer his name or wait for an invitation, just stepped past her and set the box on the lab bench with the careful deliberation of someone who'd spent his life handling fragile things. Sarah caught a glimpse of the contents, canned goods, a loaf of bread, a carton of eggs nested in newspaper. I'm Sarah Chen, she said to his back, the researcher, I know who you are. He turned and she saw his eyes for the first time, pale blue, the color of water seen through ice holding an expression she couldn't read. Thomas Breck, I run charters out of the harbour, Margaret figured you'd need provisions before you got your bearings. Margaret being harbour master, you'll meet her when you file your survey permits. He glanced around the station taking inventory with the quick efficiency of someone cataloging a crime scene. Powers reliable except in storms, water comes from the well, tastes like iron, but it's clean. Cell signals useless past the point, so don't count on calling for help if you need it. That's reassuring. Something flickered across his face, not quite a smile, but it's distant relative. Wasn't meant to be, salt may as not a place that reassures. He moved toward the door and Sarah found herself speaking before she'd decided to. The contamination in the bay, she said, the readings go back decades. Do people hear talk about where it came from? Thomas Breck stopped with his hand on the door frame, he didn't turn around. People here don't talk about much of anything, Dr Chen, that's how we've stayed a community this long. He paused and when he spoke again his voice was quieter, stripped of its gruff performance. The water's been wrong since before I was born. My father knew it. His father knew it. Knowing didn't change anything for them and it won't change anything for you. I'm not here to change anything, I'm here to document. You're here because you're looking for something. Now he did turn and his ice water eyes held hers with an intensity that made her breath catch. Everyone who comes to salt mere is looking for something. The smart ones leave before they find it. He walked out into the fog and Sarah stood in the doorway watching him disappear. His shape thinning by degrees until he was just a suggestion of movement and then nothing at all. She spent the afternoon unpacking her equipment, the portable spectrometer, the sample containers, the GPS unit that would log her collection sites with coordinates precise enough to reconstruct her movements years from now if anyone cared to. The work was meditative, each item finding its place on the bench or the shelf, the chaos of arrival resolving into the order of a functioning laboratory. By four o'clock the fog had returned in force and Sarah found herself standing at the window, her reflection ghosted against the gray trying to see the water she'd come here to study. Her mother had never talked about salt mere. That silence had been so complete, so airtight that Sarah hadn't even known there was something to not talk about until she was 23 sorting through her mother's papers after the funeral and found the newspaper clipping folded into the back of a photo album. Researcher missing off Pacific Coast, the headline read, Dr Helen Lou 34 Marine Biologist. The article was dated June 1962. It mentioned salt mere only once in passing as the location where Dr. Lou had been conducting field work before her disappearance. Presumed drowned, the article said. Body never recovered. Sarah had spent six years not thinking about that clipping. She'd finished her doctorate, married, divorced, built a career on the safe foundation of peer-reviewed publications and reproducible results. She'd become, by careful design, the kind of scientist who documented rather than discovered, who confirmed rather than questioned. And then the grant had come through and she'd written salt mere bay on the application without letting herself examine why. And now she was here, standing in a prefab box at the edge of the continent, waiting for the fog to clear so she could look at water that had swallowed her grandmother without a trace. She wasn't looking for anything. She was here to take samples, run analyses, write a report that would gather dust in some agency's archive. The lie felt thinner every time she told it. At six o'clock hunger drove her out of the station and down the gravel road toward the center of town. The fog had lifted slightly. She could see perhaps 50 yards now, enough to make out the shapes of buildings emerging from the gray like photographs developing in solution. Salt mere wasn't much. A main street with a hardware store, a diner, a church with a steeple that vanished into the mist. A gas station with two pumps and a hand-lettered sign advertising bait. A general store with a broad front porch and windows full of things Sarah couldn't quite make out through the condensation. She was halfway to the diner when she felt it. The sensation of being watched. It wasn't paranoia. She'd done enough fieldwork in enough remote places to know the difference between imagination and instinct. Someone's attention had settled on her like a physical weight pressing against the back of her neck. And when she turned to look, she saw the car. A black sedan older model parked in front of the general store. Behind the wheel sat a woman with silver hair perfectly composed, watching Sarah with the patient attention of someone who had been waiting for exactly this moment. Their eyes met through the fog and the windshield. The woman didn't look away, didn't pretend she hadn't been staring. Her expression held no hostility, no welcome, only a kind of assessment, like a collector examining a new acquisition. Sarah felt her hand rise in an automatic wave, the reflexive politeness of a newcomer trying to belong. The woman in the car didn't respond. She simply reached forward, started her engine, and pulled away from the curb with unhurried precision. Her tail lights dissolving into the gray until Sarah stood alone on the empty street, the fog pressing in around her like a held breath. She would learn later that the woman's name was Eleanor Cross, and that the general store was hers. As was the building that housed it, as was the land beneath it, as was, in ways both legal and less so most of the town itself. But in that moment, Sarah knew only that she had been seen and measured, and that some verdict had been rendered in a language she didn't yet speak. She turned and walked toward the diner, the fog closing behind her like a curtain.",
