  "text": " the harbour office occupied the ground floor of a building that had been something else first. A chandlery maybe, or a fish-buyer's station, its bones still visible beneath the municipal paint and the county seal on the door. Sarah found it by following the smell of diesel and creasote down the main dock, past rows of fishing boats in various states of disrepair. Their names painted on trancems in letters that had faded to whispers. Mary Ellen, second chance, no promises. She'd spent the morning at the research station, organizing equipment she'd already organized, reviewing protocols she'd memorized months ago, avoidance dressed up as preparation. By ten o'clock she couldn't stand the prefab walls anymore, and so here she was, clutching the permit applications the university had sent, looking for the harbour master like a student reporting to the principal's office. The door was unlocked. Inside a single room divided by a counter, the walls covered in nautical charts and tide tables and photographs that Sarah's eyes went to immediately, hungrily, scanning for faces she might recognise. The photos were old, black and white, then faded colour, showing the waterfront across decades. Men in work clothes, standing beside catches, a crowd gathered for some long ago celebration. The cannery in its operating days, smoke rising from stacks that no longer existed. Dr. Chen, I assume. Sarah turned, the woman who'd spoken stood in a doorway she hadn't noticed, holding a coffee mug with both hands like she was warming herself against a chill that existed only for her. Mid fifties, steel grey hair cut practical and short, a face that might have been called handsome if it hadn't been so carefully arranged into neutrality. Margaret Holloway, the woman said, I'm the harbour master, Thomas mentioned you derived. He brought supplies, that was kind. That was my doing, kindness is a strong word for anything that happens in saltmere. Margaret moved behind the counter, setting her mug down beside a stack of papers. You have permit applications. Sarah handed them over and watched as Margaret read through the forms with the unhurried attention of someone who'd seen a thousand of these and found them all wanting. The silence stretched, Sarah's eyes drifted back to the photographs on the wall. The cannery, she said, when did it close? 1968. Margaret didn't look up from the paperwork, before my time as harbour master, but not by much. What happened? The fish happened, fewer every year, hard to run a cannery when there's nothing to can. Margaret flipped a page, frowned at something. Your sampling sites include the deep channel. The contamination readings are highest there. Whatever the source is, the source is history, Dr Chen. 50 years of a working waterfront, you'll find plenty of contamination, heavy metals, industrial residue, all the things a fishing community accumulates when it's trying to survive. Margaret looked up and her eyes held the same assessing quality Sarah had seen in Eleanor Cross's gaze the night before, but warmer somehow, sadder. The question is whether finding it will do anyone any good. Understanding contamination patterns is the first step toward what? Margaret's voice was gentle, which made the interruption worse. Remediation that the county can't afford, litigation against companies that dissolved decades ago, a report that confirms what everyone here already knows, that the water is dying and has been dying since before most of us were born. Sarah felt heat rising to her cheeks, toward documentation, toward the scientific record, toward making sure someone knows what happened here even if she stopped, even if the words had nearly escaped, even if that's all I can do for her. Margaret watched her and something shifted in the older woman's expression, a softening or maybe a recognition. She set the permit applications aside. There was another researcher, Margaret said quietly. A long time ago, a woman from the university, like you, she came to study the same things you're here to study. Sarah's heart was suddenly loud in her ears. What happened to her? She left. Margaret picked up her coffee, took a sip, set it down again, the gestures of someone buying time. Also, I'm told I was a child then, but people talked about her for years afterward. The woman who came asking questions and then simply wasn't here anymore. Do you remember her name? The pause lasted three heartbeats. Four. No, Margaret said, I don't suppose I do. It was a lie. Sarah knew it was a lie the way she knew the tide tables on the wall, the way she knew the chemical signatures of contaminated water, with certainty that required no proof. Margaret Holloway remembered the name. She remembered everything about that woman, whoever she'd been. And she had chosen, in this moment, not to say. The permits were approved by noon, stamped and signed with Margaret's efficient signature. A company by a list of restricted areas Sarah was required to avoid. The old canary property, the private docks north of town, the waters within a hundred yards of the cross-family pier. Safety concerns, Margaret said, by way of explanation. The structures are unstable. We've had accidents. Sarah didn't argue. She folded the permits into her bag and thanked Margaret for her time and walked out into a day that had brightened without her noticing. The fog retreated to a gray line on the horizon. The water of the harbour revealed at last as dark and flat and still, like a held breath. She stood on the dock for a long time, looking at the boats and the water and the far shore, where the canary ruins hunched against the tree line. The restricted areas. The places she wasn't supposed to go. Her grandmother had come here asking questions. Her grandmother had simply wasn't here anymore. Sarah had spent six years telling herself she didn't need to know what that meant. Six years of not thinking about the clipping, not researching the name, not following the thread that would lead her here, to this dock, to this water, to the silence that closed around every question she asked. She wasn't going to spend six more. The walk back to the research station took her past the general store, and this time the black sedan wasn't there. The porch empty except for a cat cleaning itself in a patch of sun. But as Sarah passed, the door opened, and the silver-haired woman from the night before emerged with a paper bag in her arms, moving with the careful grace of someone who had never rushed anywhere in her life. Dr. Chen, Sarah stopped. She hadn't given anyone her name except Thomas and Margaret, but of course it wouldn't matter. In a town this size, a newcomer's name would travel faster than the newcomer herself. Mrs. Cross, she said, guessing, the general store is yours? Among other things, Ellen across descended the porch steps, unhurried, her eyes never leaving Sarah's face. Up close, she was older than she'd appeared through the car window, late 70s perhaps, but age had refined rather than diminished her. She looked like something carved from driftwood, all the softness weathered away, only the essential shape remaining. I understand you'll be studying our water. Ellen's voice was pleasant, conversational, looking for contamination I'm told, sources and patterns. That's right. A worthy endeavor. Science has given us so much. Elleners shifted the bag in her arms, a gesture that seemed almost theatrical. My husband used to say that the bay had secrets, but that secrets weren't the same as lies. Secrets are simply truths that haven't found their moment. Sarah waited. There was more coming. She could feel it gathering like weather. The question of course is whether the moment ever comes. Whether some truths are better left where they are, doing no harm, bothering no one. Elleners smiled and the smile was warm and cold at once, like sunlight on ice. But I'm sure a scientist doesn't think that way. You believe in discovery for its own sake. I believe in documentation, Sarah said carefully, in understanding what's there. And if what's there is something that would hurt good people. People who had no part in whatever happened, but who would suffer all the same if old wounds were reopened. Ellen attilted her head, bird-like. What does science say about that? I don't know what you're asking me. No, Elleners said, you don't. But you will. She walked past Sarah toward the black sedan that had somehow appeared without Sarah noticing, parked at the curb as if it had always been there. She opened the door, set the bag inside and paused with her hand on the frame. Welcome to salt me a doctor-chan. I hope you find what you're looking for. She met Sarah's eyes one last time, but not too much of it. Some things stay buried for good reason. The door closed, the engine started. The sedan pulled away and Sarah stood alone on the sidewalk, the sun warm on her face and a coldness spreading through her chest that had nothing to do with temperature. She had come here to document contamination, to take samples and write reports and contribute to the scientific record. She had come here if she was honest and she was trying finally to be honest to find out what happened to her grandmother. But standing in the two bright sunshine with Ellen across his words settling into her bones, Sarah understood for the first time that finding out might cost more than not knowing. And she understood, with equal clarity, that she was going to do it anyway.",
