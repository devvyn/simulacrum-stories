### Edit Points for DAW

The following timestamps need attention (add/extend pauses):

- **02:54.10** (Section 1 end): Current pause 0.94s, need ≥1.5s
- **02:54.10** (Section 2 end): Current pause 0.94s, need ≥1.5s
- **02:07.80** (Section 3 end): Current pause 1.02s, need ≥1.5s

**Recommended action:** Insert 1.5-2.0s silence at each marked timestamp.

### Editing Notes

Section breaks (`---` in manuscript) should produce audible pauses of 1.5-2.0 seconds.
This signals a scene change or time skip to the listener.

**Options for fixing:**
1. Insert silence in DAW at marked timestamps
2. Re-generate specific sections with pause markers in TTS prompt
3. Accept current pacing if natural pauses exist elsewhere
