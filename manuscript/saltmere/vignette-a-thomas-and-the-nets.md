# Vignette A: Thomas and the Nets

*Fifteen years before Sarah Chen's arrival*

---

The nets came up heavy.

Thomas knew the difference between heavy-with-fish and heavy-with-something-else, had known it since he was old enough to work the winch on his father's boat. Fish moved, even dead fish, their weight shifting with the pull of the cables, distributing itself through the mesh in patterns you learned to read like weather. Something-else just hung there, inert, dragging against the mechanism with the particular stubbornness of objects that had never been alive.

He was alone on the water that night. His son had stopped fishing with him three years ago, moved to Portland, taken the grandchild Thomas barely knew. His wife was five years dead. The boat was called *Nothing Personal*, and he'd named it that as a joke, back when he still made jokes, back when the catches were good and the water was just water and he could pretend he didn't know what he knew.

The winch groaned. Thomas watched the cables rise from the dark water, watched the net surface like something breaching, and felt the familiar knot tighten in his stomach. He'd been fishing the deep channel—stupid, he knew it was stupid, but the shallow waters were empty and a man had to eat—and the deep channel gave up things it shouldn't.

The net broke the surface. Kelp, debris, the usual garbage of a bay that had been treated as a dumping ground for longer than Thomas had been alive. And tangled in the mess, pale against the dark water, something that made him stop breathing.

Bones. Human bones, or what was left of them after however many years in the water. A skull, cracked and stained. A ribcage, collapsed. Fragments of what might have been clothing, might have been nothing, impossible to tell after so long.

Thomas stood at the rail, looking down at the remains of a person, and felt the world narrow to a single point.

He should radio the coast guard. Should bring the net aboard, secure the remains, report the find to the authorities. That was what you did when you found a body. That was what the law required, what decency demanded, what his father—dead now, like everyone who might have told him what to do—would have expected.

But his father had also taught him other things. Had taught him what questions not to ask, what waters not to fish, what secrets Saltmere kept and why. His father had taken him to Site 7 once, when he was fourteen, and he'd watched Eleanor Cross drop something wrapped in canvas into the dark water. His father had never spoken of it again, and Thomas had understood that some silences were mandatory.

If he reported this, they would ask questions. Where did you find it? How deep? What were you doing in the deep channel? And then they would start looking, and they would find more than one set of bones, and everything that Saltmere had built on silence would come apart.

Or they wouldn't find anything. They would write it off as a drowning, an accident, someone who'd fallen off a boat decades ago and been forgotten. They would ask no questions, because asking questions wasn't what happened in Saltmere. And Thomas would have to live with the look in their eyes—the look that said they knew, and he knew, and everyone knew, and no one would ever say it out loud.

He stood at the rail for a long time. The fog pressed in around the boat, muffling everything, making the world small and close and private. The bones stared up at him with empty sockets, patient, beyond caring what he decided.

*Someone's daughter,* he thought. *Someone's mother. Someone who had a name and a life and people who loved her, and now she's tangled in my nets in the middle of the night, and I'm the only one who will ever know.*

He thought about Helen Liu. He'd been seventeen when she disappeared—young enough to be scared, old enough to understand. He remembered her face, her serious eyes, the way she'd asked him questions he'd been too frightened to answer honestly. She'd believed in truth. She'd died for it. And now, maybe, she was here—one of the many secrets the bay had swallowed, one of the many bodies that had been *resolved.*

Thomas reached for the winch controls.

He could do the right thing. Could bring her aboard, whoever she was, and give her back to the world. Could break the silence his father had taught him, could be the one who finally said what everyone knew and no one spoke.

His hand hovered over the lever.

*If you do this, you lose everything.* The voice in his head sounded like his father, like Eleanor, like the whole town speaking with one throat. *The boat. The license. Your place in this community. Everything you've built, everything you are. For what? For bones that have been down there for years? For a truth that won't change anything?*

He thought about his grandson. About the child support he sent every month, the visits that were getting less frequent, the thin thread that still connected him to something beyond this boat and this water and this endless gray.

He thought about what kind of man he wanted to be.

And then he lowered the net back into the water.

He watched the bones sink—slowly, gently, returning to the darkness they'd come from. The skull went last, tilting back as if looking up at him, as if memorizing his face for some future reckoning.

Thomas stood at the rail until the fog swallowed everything, until there was nothing to see but gray, until he could almost pretend it hadn't happened.

Then he started the engine and went home.

---

He never told anyone. Not his son, not the bartender at the harbor tavern, not the priest at confession. He carried it the way you carry a stone in your pocket—always there, always heavy, always pressing against you when you moved.

Some nights he dreamed about it. The skull looking up at him. The empty sockets asking why. He would wake in the dark of his empty house and lie there until dawn, thinking about the person he'd chosen not to be.

Fifteen years later, when Sarah Chen arrived in Saltmere asking questions about contamination and history and a grandmother who'd disappeared, Thomas would recognize something in her face. The same seriousness Helen Liu had carried. The same belief that truth was worth pursuing, worth dying for.

And he would think about the bones in his net, and the choice he'd made, and the weight of it pressing against him like the water pressed against the hull of his boat.

This time, he would decide, he would do it differently.

This time, he would tell the truth.

It was fifteen years too late. But it was something.

**Editorial Notes:**

- Word count: ~1,100
- Thomas's defining moment: the choice that haunts him
- Internal monologue reveals complicity's psychology
- Connection to Helen Liu (he wonders if it's her)
- Setup for his arc: "This time, he would tell the truth"
- The skull "memorizing his face" = guilt externalized
- Fog as concealment (moral and literal)
