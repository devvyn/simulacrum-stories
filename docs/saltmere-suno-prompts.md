## Generation Workflow

1. Generate each prompt 2-3 times in Suno
2. Select best take based on:
   - Loop-ability (clean start/end)
   - Consistency of mood
   - Mix compatibility (not too busy)
3. Download as WAV for mixing headroom
4. Trim to clean loop points
5. Test under sample narration at -22dB

---

## Budget Estimate

- 12 primary tracks × 3 generations = 36 generations
- 3 ambient layers × 2 generations = 6 generations
- Total: ~42 Suno generations
- Suno Pro: 500 credits/month, 10 credits/generation = ~50 available

Fits within one billing cycle.
