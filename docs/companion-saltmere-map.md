## Key Locations

### 1. The Research Station
**Location:** Eastern bluff overlooking the bay
**Description:** Converted fisherman's cottage, single room with cot and desk. Spectacular view of the bay and deep channel. Isolated—twenty-minute walk to town.
**Significance:** Where Sarah Chen stays. Where Helen Liu stayed in 1962. The window faces Site 7.

### 2. Cross General Store
**Location:** Main Street, center of town
**Description:** Two-story wooden building, store below, Eleanor's apartment above. Unchanged since the 1950s. Creaking floors, everything overpriced, everyone comes here anyway.
**Significance:** Eleanor's seat of power. Where she holds court, gathers information, issues warnings wrapped in hospitality.

### 3. Harbor Office
**Location:** Waterfront, adjacent to the fish market
**Description:** Clapboard building, always needs paint. Margaret Holloway's domain. Filing cabinets full of permits, manifests, and her father's secrets.
**Significance:** Where Margaret keeps Robert's documentation. Where Sarah comes for permits and stays for answers.

### 4. The Library
**Location:** Main Street, east end
**Description:** Stone building, oldest in town. Saltmere Historical Collection in the basement. Edith Pemberton has worked here for sixty-two years.
**Significance:** Where records have been removed—and where copies have been kept.

### 5. The Cannery (Closed)
**Location:** Cannery Point, western headland
**Description:** Massive wooden structure, three stories, abandoned for thirty years. Machinery still inside, frozen mid-operation. Locked. Eleanor holds the only key.
**Significance:** Where the decisions were made. Where the manifests are hidden. Where the confrontation happens.

### 6. The Lighthouse
**Location:** Tip of the western headland
**Description:** Automated now, no keeper. Still functional. Beam sweeps the bay every twelve seconds.
**Significance:** Navigation reference. Visible from the research station. Mentioned in Thomas's night fishing.

### 7. Site 7 (Deep Channel)
**Location:** Center of the deep channel, 47 fathoms (282 feet)
**Description:** Nothing visible on the surface. Below: an estimated 40-60 55-gallon drums, military surplus containers, and—according to the manifests—nine human bodies.
**Significance:** The heart of the mystery. What the bay swallowed. What Sarah's contamination readings led her to.

### 8. The Fuel Dock
**Location:** Northern end of the harbor
**Description:** Single pump, diesel only. William Breck refueled here for forty years. Thomas still does.
**Significance:** Where fishermen gather. Where information circulates. Where Thomas almost spoke to Helen in 1962.

## The Deep Channel

The deep channel is a natural underwater canyon carved during the last ice age. It runs northwest from the inner bay toward open ocean, reaching depths of 50+ fathoms (300+ feet).

**Why it matters:**
- Currents carry debris northwest, away from shore
- Depth makes recovery difficult (1962 technology couldn't reach it)
- Cold water slows decomposition
- The contamination plume follows the channel floor

**What's down there:**
- Industrial waste drums (1947-1958)
- Military surplus containers (1953-1956)
- An unknown number of human remains (1949-1958)
- Helen Liu's backup documentation in a waterproof case (1962-2012)

## Seasonal Considerations

**Spring (March-May):** Fog frequent, storms tapering. Fishing season begins.

**Summer (June-August):** Clearest weather, but fog can roll in without warning. Peak tourist season (such as it is). Helen Liu arrived in May, died in June.

**Fall (September-November):** Storms return. Fishing slows. The town turns inward.

**Winter (December-February):** Heavy rain, occasional snow. Harbor mostly empty. Eleanor's store busiest—nowhere else to go.

**Sarah's arrival:** Early spring 2012. The story spans approximately six weeks.

## Map Usage Notes

**For audiobook listeners:** Reference while listening to orient scenes.

**For tabletop RPG:** Use distances and travel times for pacing. The isolation of the research station matters—Sarah can't just walk to help.

**For Investigation Board:** Pin locations with character associations. Track who was where when.

**For visual adaptation:** This ASCII map is a reference. A proper illustrated version should capture:
- The fog (always present, varying density)
- The grey-green water
- The weathered wood of every building
- The emptiness between structures

## Historical Layers

**Pre-1900:** Indigenous fishing grounds. No permanent European settlement.

**1900-1940:** Fishing village established. Cannery built 1923. Peak population ~1,200.

**1940-1960:** Cannery thrives, then declines. Dumping begins 1947. Cover-ups begin 1949.

**1960-1980:** Helen Liu investigation and death (1962). Cannery closes (1968). Population decline begins.

**1980-2012:** Slow decay. Margaret inherits harbor office (1985). Fishing catches decline. EPA announces contamination study (2011).

**2012:** Sarah Chen arrives. The fifty-year silence breaks.
