## The Premise

Fourteen people vanished in Saltmere between 1947 and 1962. The official explanations: drownings, accidents, "moved away." The truth: murdered and dumped in the bay by the town's founding families, silenced to protect a conspiracy of industrial dumping, government contracts, and generational complicity.

Fifty years later, the contamination has reached critical levels. An EPA study is underway. And the last survivor of the generation that made the decisions—Eleanor Cross, 78—is prepared to add to the body count if necessary.

The investigators arrive in Saltmere with their own reasons. They will discover the truth. The question is whether they survive it—and what they choose to do with what they learn.

## For the Keeper

### What's Really Happening

**1947-1958:** The Saltmere Cannery, owned by the Cross family, dumped industrial waste in the deep channel of the bay. When regulations tightened, they began dumping at night. When workers and outsiders noticed, some were paid off. Others were "resolved."

**1962:** Dr. Helen Liu, a marine biologist, conducted a contamination survey. She discovered the dump site and, through library records, the pattern of disappearances. She confronted Eleanor Cross. Within 24 hours, she was dead—the ninth victim.

**2012:** Sarah Chen, Helen's granddaughter, has arrived on an EPA grant. She doesn't know she's Helen's granddaughter (or she's pretending not to know). Her investigation is the catalyst that will crack the silence open—unless Eleanor stops her first.

### The Power Structure

**Eleanor Cross** - The matriarch. Ordered the killings (her husband and Robert Holloway did the actual work). Believes she protected her town. Would do it again.

**Margaret Holloway** - Eleanor's protégé, Robert's daughter. Inherited the harbor master position and her father's documentation. Exhausted by the weight. Can be turned.

**Thomas Breck** - Third-generation fisherman, 70. Was 17 when Helen Liu died. Found bones in his nets fifteen years ago, threw them back. Ready to talk.

**Edith Pemberton** - Town librarian, 92. Kept copies of Helen Liu's research for fifty years. Waiting for someone worth giving them to.

**Sarah Chen** - The catalyst. NPC unless investigators need a guide. She's already in danger.

## Act Structure

### Act 1: Arrival (Session 1 or first 2 hours)

**Objective:** Establish investigators, introduce the town, plant seeds of wrongness.

**Scenes:**
- Arrive in Saltmere. Note the fog, the quiet, the way conversations pause when you enter.
- Meet Margaret at the harbor office for permits/lodging. She's helpful. Too helpful?
- Visit Cross General Store. Eleanor assesses the new arrivals. Warm hospitality, probing questions.
- First hint: library records have missing pages. Fishermen won't discuss "the deep channel."

**Clues available:**
- Newspaper clipping (1962): "RESEARCHER MISSING"
- Contamination readings from Sarah's early work (if investigators find the research station)
- Thomas's guarded comment: "People who ask questions here... sometimes they stop asking."

**Escalation trigger:** If investigators mention Helen Liu by name, Eleanor takes notice.

---

### Act 2: Investigation (Session 2 or hours 2-4)

**Objective:** Gather evidence, form alliances, feel pressure mount.

**Scenes:**
- Find Thomas at the harbor. Earn his trust. He'll tell you about the bones.
- Research in the library. Edith is watching. If you ask the right questions, she leaves a note.
- Return to Margaret. Confront her with what you've found. She cracks—admits she has her father's files.
- Eleanor's warning. Tea invitation or direct confrontation. She makes clear: some truths are better buried.
- The research station ransacked. Sarah's notes scattered. Message received.

**Clues available:**
- Thomas's testimony (the bones, what his father wouldn't say)
- Edith's copies (Helen Liu's field notes, the "R" entries in the manifests)
- Margaret's files (shipping manifests, Site 7 coordinates)
- The cylinder Thomas pulled from his nets (military surplus markings)

**Escalation triggers:**
- Investigators befriend Thomas → Social pressure applied to him
- Investigators access library restricted section → Pages go missing overnight
- Investigators confront Margaret → Her house is broken into; files at risk

---

### Act 3: The Cannery (Session 3 or hours 4-5)

**Objective:** Break into the cannery, find the final evidence, get trapped.

**Scenes:**
- Learn the cannery has been locked for thirty years. Eleanor holds the only key.
- Break in at night (or acquire key through social means).
- Inside: machinery frozen mid-operation, offices with papers on desks, a locked basement door.
- Find the ledger. Fourteen names. Dates. "Resolved."
- Eleanor's car pulls up outside. You're trapped.

**Clues available:**
- Robert Holloway's office (photographs, personal effects)
- The ledger (conclusive evidence)
- The basement door (padlock scratched with "SITE 7 - RC")
- What's in the basement? Up to the Keeper. Bodies? Documentation? Nothing—and that's worse?

**Escalation trigger:** Investigators are caught. Act 3 ends with confrontation imminent.

---

### Act 4: Reckoning (Session 4 or final hour)

**Objective:** Confront Eleanor, make the choice, live with the consequences.

**Scenes:**
- Eleanor enters the cannery. Three-way confrontation: Eleanor, investigators, Thomas (if he's with them).
- Eleanor's justification: "I did what I had to do. The cannery employed half this town. The government contracts kept us alive. The people who died would have destroyed everything."
- She offers a deal: walk away, the contamination gets cleaned up quietly, no one else needs to know.
- Margaret arrives. She has the files—not to hide them, but to hand them over. She's made her choice.
- Eleanor's final play (Keeper's choice): violence, escape attempt, or—canonically—her heart gives out.

**Resolution paths:**
- **Truth prevails:** Evidence reaches authorities. Eleanor arrested (or dead). Town torn apart, but healing begins.
- **Tragedy:** Investigators become victims 15-16. Silence continues. (Best for horror systems like Dread or Ten Candles.)
- **Compromise:** Partial truth. Eleanor dies before trial. Town lives with ambiguity.
- **Complicity:** Investigators accept Eleanor's framing. Leave with the secret. Carry the weight forever.

## Handouts

### Handout A: Newspaper Clipping (1962)
```
SALTMERE TRIBUNE - June 17, 1962

RESEARCHER REPORTED MISSING

Dr. Helen Liu (34), a marine biologist from the University of
Washington, has been reported missing after failing to return
from a research outing in Saltmere Bay.

Dr. Liu was conducting a contamination survey for the National
Science Foundation. She was last seen on June 15 near the old
cannery.

Coast Guard search continues. No foul play suspected at this time.
```

### Handout B: Helen Liu's Final Entry (June 15, 1962)
```
I know what's in the deep channel.

Not just waste. Not just drums.

The deep channel is a graveyard. The "resolved" were people who saw
too much, asked too much, threatened the families who run this town.

Mrs. Pemberton has copies. If something happens to me, she knows
what to do.

Meeting with Eleanor at 2pm. I'm going to give her one chance
to do this the right way.

I don't think she'll take it.
```

```

### Handout D: Thomas's Testimony
*For Keeper to paraphrase in character*

> "Fifteen years ago, I was fishing the deep channel. You're not supposed to, but the catch was bad that year. Net came up heavy. Thought I'd snagged debris.
>
> It was bones. Human bones. Wrapped in what was left of canvas.
>
> I threw them back. Didn't tell anyone. Not my father, not the harbor master, not the coast guard.
>
> I've been throwing things back my whole life. Pretending not to see.
>
> I'm tired of pretending."

## Keeper Tips

### Tone
This isn't pulp horror. No monsters. No supernatural. The horror is human—what communities sacrifice to survive, what silence costs, how complicity compounds across generations.

Play Eleanor sympathetically. She believes she saved her town. She's wrong, but she's not a cartoon villain. The tragedy is that she could have been right—if she'd stopped earlier, if she'd chosen accountability over silence.

### Pacing
Slow burn. Let conversations breathe. Let the fog settle. The tension comes from what's unsaid, not what's shown.

If using for one-shot: Start in medias res. Investigators already know something's wrong. Skip the "everything seems normal" phase.

If using for mini-campaign: Let Act 2 sprawl. More time with Thomas. More library research. More tea with Eleanor. The relationships matter.

### The Choice
The ending should feel like a choice, not a climax. Investigators have the evidence. They can do the right thing, but the right thing has costs. Let them argue about it.

Don't force resolution. If they choose complicity, that's a valid ending. They leave Saltmere carrying what they know. That's horror too.

### System Notes

**Call of Cthulhu:** Sanity loss from moral horror, not cosmic. Finding the ledger: 1/1d4. Choosing complicity: 1d6/1d10.

**GUMSHOE:** Core clues are guaranteed. The drama is in how they're found and what investigators do with them.

**Brindlewood Bay:** This is almost a Brindlewood scenario already. The mystery is dark, but the cozy elements (the library, the tea, Thomas's boat) balance it.

**Dread:** Perfect for one-shot. Pull when confronting Eleanor. Pull when entering the cannery at night. The tower falls and someone doesn't leave Saltmere.
