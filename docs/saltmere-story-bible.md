## Characters

### Sarah Chen (Protagonist)
**Role:** Marine biologist, outsider, truth-seeker
**Age:** ~29 (finds clipping at 23, six years later arrives in Saltmere)
**Arc:** From scientific detachment → personal reckoning → agent of change

**Backstory:** Raised by her mother in Seattle after her grandmother (Dr. Helen Liu) vanished during research in Saltmere in 1962. Sarah's mother never spoke of it. After her mother's death, Sarah found her grandmother's research notes and applied for the Saltmere marine survey position—telling herself it was coincidence.

**What she wants:** Scientific truth about the contamination
**What she needs:** To understand her family's connection to this place
**Flaw:** Intellectualizes emotion, avoids personal stakes
**Secret:** She knows exactly why she came here—she's been lying to herself

**Voice:** Precise, observant, slightly detached. Internal monologue rich with scientific metaphor that gradually gives way to emotional language.

### Margaret Holloway
**Role:** Harbor master, gatekeeper, conflicted loyalist
**Age:** Mid-50s
**Arc:** From protector of secrets → crisis of conscience → active choice

**Backstory:** Daughter of Robert Holloway, who coordinated the dumping and cover-up. Raised to understand that some truths destroy more than they reveal. Took over as harbor master after her father's stroke, inheriting both the position and the burden of knowledge.

**What she wants:** To protect the town and honor her father's legacy
**What she needs:** To stop carrying her father's sins
**Flaw:** Confuses loyalty with love
**Secret:** She has her father's documentation—manifests, maps, everything. She's been the gatekeeper for thirty years.

**Voice:** Measured, maternal on the surface, with occasional cracks revealing deep fatigue.

---

### Thomas Breck
**Role:** Third-generation fisherman, witness, reluctant ally
**Age:** ~70 (was 17 when Helen Liu disappeared in 1962)
**Arc:** From passive complicity → active witness → moral stand

**Backstory:** His grandfather and father both fished these waters and both stayed silent. Thomas has pulled things from his nets he shouldn't have—and thrown them back. He's watched the fish die, the catches shrink, his livelihood disappear. He's tired of pretending not to see.

**What he wants:** To keep fishing, keep his head down, survive
**What he needs:** To stop being complicit in his own destruction
**Flaw:** Pragmatism as excuse for cowardice
**Secret:** He found human remains in his nets fifteen years ago. He told no one.

**Voice:** Sparse, weathered, metaphors drawn from the sea. Says little, notices everything.

---

### Eleanor Cross
**Role:** Matriarch, antagonist, keeper of the full truth
**Age:** Late 70s (~78)
**Arc:** From absolute control → challenged authority → final gambit

**Backstory:** The last surviving member of the generation that made the decisions. Her husband ran the cannery; she managed the aftermath. She knows everything—the dumping, the cover-up, what happened to Helen Liu. She has protected this town for fifty years by being the one person willing to do what others wouldn't.

**What she wants:** To die with the secrets intact
**What she needs:** (Tragic antagonist—she won't get what she needs)
**Flaw:** Believes her sins were necessary, which makes them unforgivable
**Secret:** She ordered Helen Liu's death. She would do it again.

**Voice:** Precise, controlled, occasionally revealing glimpses of the weight she carries. Never explains, never apologizes.

## The Central Mystery

### What Happened (The Truth)

**1947-1958:** The Saltmere Cannery, owned by the Cross family, disposed of industrial waste in the bay. When regulations tightened, they began disposing at night in the deep channel. Other things went into those barrels too—records, evidence, and eventually, people who asked too many questions.

**1962:** Dr. Helen Liu (age 34), a marine biologist studying contamination patterns, discovered the dump sites. She confronted Eleanor Cross with her findings. Within a week, she vanished. Her research disappeared. Her death was staged as a drowning—body never recovered.

**~2012 (Present):** Fifty years later, the contamination has reached critical levels. Sarah Chen's arrival—ostensibly for an EPA-funded contamination study—is the catalyst that will finally crack the silence open.

### What Sarah Discovers (The Investigation)

1. **Surface level:** Contamination patterns indicate a point source in the deep channel
2. **Historical level:** Her grandmother researched the same patterns, then vanished
3. **Personal level:** Helen Liu didn't just disappear—she was silenced
4. **Final revelation:** Eleanor Cross ordered the murder; Margaret's father executed it

## Notes for the Simulacrum

The simulacrum layer can continue generating:
- Scene variations to consider
- Dialogue alternatives
- "What if" scenarios for editorial selection
- Character voice samples
- Atmospheric descriptions

The publisher layer selects and shapes. The simulacrum proposes; the editor disposes.
