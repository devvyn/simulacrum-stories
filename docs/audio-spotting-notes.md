# Saltmere Audio Spotting Notes

**Purpose**: Scene-by-scene music/ambient prescriptions for hybrid mixing approach
**Date**: 2026-01-10

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Music structural, not continuous**: Entry at chapter open, major transitions, chapter close
2. **Silence during dialogue**: Let conversations breathe, especially emotional ones
3. **Ambient continuous**: Harbor/ocean at -25dB throughout as foundation
4. **Emotional matching**: Music selected for scene emotion, not setting/branding

---

## Track Emotional Mapping

| Track | File | Emotional Function | Best For |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | Fog and Secrets | Contemplative, mysterious | Arrivals, observations, interiority |
| 2 | The Bay Remembers | Melancholy, weight | Revelations, aftermath |
| 3 | Isolation | Loneliness, unease | Sarah alone, research station |
| 4 | Working Waterfront | Active, daytime | Brief transitions ONLY (not beds) |
| 5 | Abandoned Industry | Decay, dread | Cannery scenes |
| 6 | Eleanor's Domain | Menace, formality | Eleanor scenes specifically |
| 7 | Investigation Rising | Tension, urgency | Short stings at discoveries, not beds |
| 8 | Memory and Loss | Grief, nostalgia | Helen references, Edith scenes |
| 9 | Fifty Years of Silence | Guilt, weight | Thomas confession |
| 10 | Weight Released | Catharsis | Climax resolution |
| 11 | Bittersweet Victory | Mixed emotions | Aftermath |
| 12 | The Tide Goes Out | Closure | Final chapter, credits |

## Chapter 1: The Research Station

**Status**: Current mix "almost perfect" - use as reference
**Music**: Fog and Secrets (contemplative throughout)
**Notes**: Works because single emotional tone (arrival, observation, unease)

---

## Chapter 2: The Harbor Master

**Problem**: Original used "Working Waterfront" - light-hearted tone conflicts with serious Margaret dialogue and Eleanor's threat

### Scene Breakdown

## Chapter 3: First Samples

## Chapter 4: The Librarian's Archive

### Scene Breakdown

| Timecode Est. | Scene | Emotional Tone | Music Prescription |

- Eleanor's Domain for memories of Eleanor specifically
- Investigation Rising as STING only, not bed

---

## Chapter 6: The Weight of Truth

**High emotional intensity - needs careful handling**

### Scene Breakdown

| Timecode Est. | Scene | Emotional Tone | Music Prescription |
|---------------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Intro bumper | Transition | Main theme fade |

- Investigation Rising only for driving sequence (building dread)

---

## Chapter 7: Eleanor's Warning

**The confrontation chapter - Eleanor's domain literally**

### Scene Breakdown

| Timecode Est. | Scene | Emotional Tone | Music Prescription |
|---------------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Intro bumper | Transition | Main theme fade |
| 0:30-2:00 | Invitation arrives, Sarah's thoughts | Dread, decision | Fog and Secrets |
| 2:00-3:00 | Deciding to go, preparing | Resolve | Isolation (Sarah alone) |
| 3:00-4:30 | Driving to store, arriving | Approaching menace | Eleanor's Domain (fade in) |

| 16:00-17:30 | Sarah's defiance: "I just have to make sure the truth outlives me" | Resolve crystallized | SILENCE - heroic moment needs no music |
| 17:30-18:30 | Walking to car, feeling eyes | Departure under watch | Eleanor's Domain (fading) |
| 18:30-19:30 | Research station - door open, everything gone | HORROR | SILENCE |
| 19:30-end | Outro bumper | Closure | Main theme sting (darker) |

### Key Notes
- Eleanor's Domain dominates her presence but NOT her dialogue
- The long monologue (6+ minutes) must be silent - her words are the music
- Final horror (station ransacked) in silence - bookends Ch6's ransacking

---

## Implementation Notes

### Silence Markers
Chapters 2-7 each contain 4-8 minutes of dialogue that should have NO music, only ambient. This is the key fix.

### Ambient Bed
Continuous harbor/ocean ambient at -25dB throughout all chapters. This provides cohesion without competing with dialogue.

### Music Entry/Exit Points
- Entry: Chapter open (after bumper), major scene transitions, emotional shifts
- Exit: Before significant dialogue begins, at scene breaks (---), before climactic moments
- Fade duration: 3-5 seconds

### Tracks to Avoid as Continuous Beds
- Working Waterfront (too light for most content)
- Investigation Rising (too urgent for investigation scenes)

### Tracks That Work as Beds (low level)
- Fog and Secrets (contemplative, flexible)
- Memory and Loss (grief contexts only)
- Eleanor's Domain (Eleanor scenes only)

## Re-Mix Priority Order

1. **Chapter 2** - Test case for hybrid approach
2. **Chapter 7** - Most complex (long Eleanor scene)
3. **Chapter 6** - High emotional stakes
4. **Chapter 5** - Thomas POV needs his palette
5. **Chapter 3** - Currently most mismatched
6. **Chapter 4** - Closest to working, needs refinement

---

## Verification

After re-mixing:
- [ ] Chapter 2: Margaret conversation feels weighty, not light
- [ ] Chapter 3: Sampling feels methodical, not urgent
- [ ] Chapter 5: Thomas's guilt comes through
- [ ] Chapter 6: Ransacked house lands with horror
- [ ] Chapter 7: Eleanor's monologue dominates without music interference
- [ ] All: Transitions feel natural, not jarring
