## Series Identity (Main Theme Exploration)

### 1. Saltmere Main - Fog and Secrets
```
Atmospheric ambient, Pacific Northwest coastal, 1970s analog warmth,
slow building tension, distant foghorn, sparse piano,
melancholic but not sad, mystery underscore,
cinematic, no vocals, 2 minutes
```

### 2. Saltmere Main - The Bay Remembers
```
Dark ambient, deep underwater texture, distant whale-like tones,
layered drones, subtle pulse like heartbeat,
environmental mystery, something hidden beneath,
cinematic score, no vocals, instrumental
```

Minimal ambient, single piano notes with long decay,
rain on metal roof, distant ocean,
lonely but purposeful, scientific detachment,
1970s analog synthesizer texture, no vocals
```

### 4. The Harbor - Working Waterfront

Acoustic folk undertones, creaking wood, lapping water,
weathered and worn, salt and diesel,
sparse acoustic guitar, low drone,
melancholic americana, instrumental only

Industrial ambient, metal groans, dripping water echoes,
rust and decay, secrets in concrete,
dark atmospheric, tension building,
horror-adjacent but restrained, no vocals
```

Chamber music elements, cold precision,
harpsichord or music box undertones,

## Emotional Textures

### 7. Investigation Rising - Building Tension
```
Minimal thriller score, pulse underneath,
strings building slowly, clock-like rhythm,
discovery and danger, truth approaching,
cinematic suspense, instrumental
```

### 8. Memory and Loss - Helen Liu

Melancholic piano and strings, 1960s warmth,
a life cut short, photographs fading,
grief held at distance, bittersweet,
intimate chamber music, no vocals
```

### 9. Thomas's Guilt - Fifty Years of Silence
```
Low drone, sparse acoustic guitar,
weight carried too long, confession approaching,
weathered and tired, regret without self-pity,
folk ambient hybrid, instrumental only
```

### 10. Eleanor's Confession - The Weight Released
```
Deathbed atmosphere, time slowing,
strings resolving, acceptance,
neither villain nor hero, just tired,
chamber music dissolution, no vocals
```

## Resolution

### 11. The Truth Surfaces - Bittersweet Victory
```
Ambient swell building to release,
light breaking through fog, catharsis,
not triumphant but honest, hard-won clarity,
cinematic resolution, orchestral elements, no vocals
```

### 12. The Tide Goes Out - Ending
```
Peaceful ambient, ocean sounds,
acceptance and continuation, life goes on,
fog lifting, morning light on water,
hopeful but earned, sparse piano resolution, no vocals
```

## Curation Checklist

After generating, ask for each sketch:

- [ ] Does this feel like Saltmere?
- [ ] Does it serve the story or distract?
- [ ] Could this loop/extend without fatigue?
- [ ] Does it leave room for voice?
- [ ] Would silence be more powerful in this moment?

## Next Steps After Curation

1. Document final palette in `docs/saltmere-sound-bible.md`
2. Proceed to voice casting (ElevenLabs voice selection)
3. Music spotting (which chapters need which beds)
4. Production (voice + music + mixing)
