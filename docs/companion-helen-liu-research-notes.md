## Survey Overview

**Objective:** Establish baseline contamination levels in Saltmere Bay following reports of fish mortality and shellfish bed decline. Assess potential sources and recommend remediation strategies.

**Sites:** 12 primary sampling locations across bay, harbor, and inlet areas. See attached map (Figure 1).

**Methods:** Sediment core sampling, water column analysis, tissue sampling from local catch (when available). Heavy metal spectrometry performed at UW lab; field measurements for pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity.

## Field Notes

### May 14, 1962

Arrived Saltmere via coastal highway. Town smaller than expected—perhaps 800 residents? Economy appears fishing-dependent. Cannery visible on the point, though Mrs. Cross at the general store says it closed "some years back." She was helpful with directions to the research station.

Station adequate if spartan. Single room, good view of the bay. Previous researcher left equipment in reasonable condition. Note: window faces northwest—will need curtains for morning light.

Called home. Mei-Lin asked when I'm coming back. Soon, sweetheart. Soon.

---

### May 16, 1962

Established Sites 1-6 along the harbor and near-shore areas. Preliminary readings within expected parameters for a working fishing harbor—slightly elevated organic matter, minor petroleum residue near the fuel dock. Nothing alarming.

Met Thomas Breck, 17, helps his father on the fishing boat "Northern Reach." Polite boy, curious about the equipment. Asked what I was looking for. "Anything that shouldn't be here," I told him.

He got quiet. Then: "You might find it."

When I asked what he meant, he said he had to get back to work.

---

### May 19, 1962

Sites 7-12 established. Site 7 is in the deep channel, approximately 47 fathoms. Difficult to sample—had to hire a boat. Thomas's father, William Breck, took me out. He was less talkative than his son.

First anomaly: sediment from Site 7 shows heavy metal concentrations significantly above baseline. Mercury at 340% expected levels. Lead, chromium, cadmium all elevated. Industrial signature, not natural weathering.

When I mentioned this to William, he said nothing. Just looked at the water.

---

### May 22, 1962

Returned to Site 7 for additional cores. Brought the Geiger counter this time—standard protocol for military surplus areas, though I have no reason to suspect...

Elevated readings. Not dangerous, but present. Something is down there that shouldn't be.

Spoke with Mrs. Cross again. She's become quite friendly—invites me for tea, asks about my work. I mentioned the anomalous readings. She went very still for a moment, then smiled and said the cannery had "some disposal issues in the early years. Nothing to worry about now."

I don't believe her.

---

### May 25, 1962

Mapped the contamination plume from Site 7. It extends northwest along the channel floor, consistent with current patterns. The source appears localized—not diffuse runoff but point-source dumping.

The fishermen avoid this area. I've asked three different boat operators to take me out there. Two refused outright. William Breck agreed, but he won't anchor over the site. "Bad water," he said.

Thomas found me at the station this evening. He wanted to talk, I think, but his father called him away before he could say whatever he came to say.

---

### May 28, 1962

Tissue samples from local catch show bioaccumulation. Mercury levels in rockfish from the deep channel are 5x higher than near-shore specimens. These fish are being sold. People are eating them.

I need to report this. But I want to understand the source first. If I go to the authorities with incomplete data, the cannery families will have time to cover their tracks.

Letter from Mei-Lin today. She drew a picture of me in a boat. "Come home soon Mama."

Soon, sweetheart.

---

### June 1, 1962

Breakthrough. The town library has records from the cannery's operating years. The librarian, Mrs. Pemberton, helped me find the shipping manifests. Most are routine—fish processing, tin supplies, fuel.

But there are gaps. 1947-1958, entire months of records are missing. The pages have been removed. Recently, judging by the binding.

Mrs. Pemberton noticed me noticing. She said nothing, but she left a note in the book I was reading: "The Cross family keeps copies. So do I."

### June 3, 1962

**SITE 7 - DETAILED ANALYSIS**

Coordinates: 47°23'18"N, 124°12'42"W
Depth: 47 fathoms (282 feet)
Bottom composition: Silt over clay, industrial debris layer at 15-20cm depth

**Contamination Profile:**
- Mercury: 340% baseline (CRITICAL)
- Lead: 280% baseline (SEVERE)
- Chromium: 195% baseline (ELEVATED)
- Cadmium: 220% baseline (SEVERE)
- Radiological: 12 mR/hr (ELEVATED - indicates military surplus)

**Physical observations:**
Debris field visible on sonar. Cylindrical objects, approximately 55-gallon drum size, scattered across 200-meter radius. Estimate 40-60 containers minimum. Likely more buried in sediment.

This is not incidental contamination. This is systematic dumping over an extended period.

---

### June 5, 1962

Mrs. Pemberton gave me copies. She's kept them for fifteen years, waiting.

The manifests tell the story:

1947-1952: "Industrial waste disposal - deep channel" - monthly entries
1953-1956: "Surplus materials - government contract" - quarterly
1957-1958: "Special handling - night operations" - no quantities listed

The signatures are consistent: Robert Holloway, Harbor Master. Eleanor Cross, Cannery Operations.

There's another category I don't understand. Entries marked only "R" with dates. No quantities, no descriptions. Seven entries between 1949 and 1958.

I asked Mrs. Pemberton what "R" meant. She looked at me for a long time. Then she said: "Resolved."

I didn't understand. Now I think I do.

---

### June 8, 1962

Tea with Eleanor Cross. Third time this week.

She asks many questions about my methodology. Where I'm sampling. What I'm finding. Who I'm talking to. She's cataloguing my knowledge, I realize. Assessing the threat.

I mentioned the anomalous readings. Just the heavy metals, not the rest. She went very still. Then smiled and said the cannery had "some disposal issues" in the early years. "The regulations were different then. Everyone did it."

"Not everyone dumped military surplus," I said.

She set down her teacup. "Dr. Liu. You're very talented. But this survey has a limited scope. Baseline contamination for the fishery report. That's what the grant specifies."

"The grant specifies I follow the evidence."

"Evidence can be... complicated. Especially in a small town."

She walked me to the door. Her hand on my arm was gentle. Her eyes were not.

"People who love this town protect it," she said. "I hope you'll remember that."

---

### June 10, 1962

Can't sleep. Went through the "R" entries again.

Cross-referenced with newspapers. Mrs. Pemberton helped.

1949 - "R" - James Whitmore, fisherman, reported missing. Body never found.
1951 - "R" - Two names. A couple. "Left town suddenly."
1953 - "R" - Martin Reeves, cannery worker. "Drowning accident."
1954 - "R" - No corresponding record I can find.
1956 - "R" - Katherine Marsh. "Moved to California."
1957 - "R" - Frank DeLuca. "Boating accident."
1958 - "R" - Peter and Anna Kowalski. "Returned to Poland."

Seven entries. Nine people.

The Kowalskis had a daughter. She was four years old in 1958. She would be eight now. Where is she?

---

### June 12, 1962

The Kowalski girl lives with relatives in Seattle. I called. Her aunt doesn't know what happened to her parents. "They went to Saltmere for work. A few months later, we got a letter saying they'd gone back to the old country. But Peter hated Poland. He'd never go back."

She asked me why I was calling. I said I was researching the town's history.

"Be careful," she said. "That town swallows people."

---

### June 14, 1962

I know what's in the deep channel.

Not just waste. Not just drums.

The deep channel is a graveyard. The "resolved" were people who saw too much, asked too much, threatened the families who run this town. They were silenced and sunk with the rest of the evidence.

I have the manifests. I have the dates. I have the missing persons records. Mrs. Pemberton has copies of everything. If something happens to me, she knows what to do.

I'm meeting with Eleanor tomorrow. I'm going to give her one chance to do this the right way—to come forward, to take responsibility, to let the authorities handle it.

I don't think she'll take it.

---

### June 15, 1962

Morning.

Wrote a letter to Mei-Lin. Told her I love her. Told her I'm proud of her. Told her that sometimes doing the right thing is hard, but it's always worth it.

I sealed it in the waterproof case with my backup documentation. Mrs. Pemberton knows where it is. If I don't come back from today's meeting, she'll know what it means.

Mei-Lin, if you ever read this: I didn't leave you. I would never leave you. Whatever they tell you, know that I loved you more than my own life, and I tried to do something that mattered.

The bay remembers everything. Someday it will tell.

Meeting with Eleanor at 2pm.

## Document Provenance

*These notes were discovered in 2012 among the personal effects of Edith Pemberton, who had kept copies for fifty years. The original field notebook was never recovered. Dr. Helen Liu was reported missing on June 16, 1962, one day after her final entry. Her body was never found.*

*The waterproof case referenced in the June 15 entry was recovered from Saltmere Bay in April 2012, during the EPA remediation survey led by Dr. Sarah Chen—Dr. Liu's granddaughter.*

*The letter inside was addressed to Liu Mei-Lin, age 6. It was delivered fifty years late.*
