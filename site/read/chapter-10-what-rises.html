        <div class="content">
            <p>Eleanor Cross died on a Tuesday, three weeks after the investigation began.</p>
            <p>She went quietly, in her own bed, with a hospice nurse and a lawyer and no family—the Cross line ended with her, childless, the dynasty she'd spent her life building dissolved into depositions and court filings. The cancer had spread faster than the doctors predicted, or perhaps she'd simply stopped fighting it. Sarah suspected the latter. Once Eleanor had decided to tell the truth, she'd had nothing left to hold on to.</p>
            <p>The town didn't know how to mourn her.</p>
            <p>For fifty years she'd been Saltmere's center of gravity—the one who decided which businesses got loans, which families got help, which secrets got kept. People had feared her, depended on her, shaped their lives around her approval or disapproval. Now she was gone, and in her absence the town was having to learn what it actually was.</p>
            <p>Sarah attended the funeral. Not out of respect—she couldn't bring herself to respect Eleanor, not even after everything—but out of a sense of completion. She needed to see it end. Needed to stand at the graveside and know that the woman who had ordered her grandmother's death was finally, irreversibly gone.</p>
            <p>The service was small. The minister spoke carefully, saying nothing that could be quoted out of context, praising Eleanor's "service to the community" without specifying what that service had entailed. A few of the older families attended, their faces closed and unreadable. Thomas stood at the back, alone, his hat in his hands.</p>
            <p>Afterward, Sarah found Margaret standing by the grave, staring at the freshly turned earth.</p>
            <p>"I thought I'd feel different," Margaret said. "I thought when she was gone, I'd finally feel... free."</p>
            <p>"And you don't?"</p>
            <p>"I feel like I'm standing at the edge of something. Like the ground that was holding me up was her, and now there's nothing." Margaret looked up, and her eyes were red-rimmed but dry. "She was a monster. I know that. I've always known that. But she was also the only person who ever made me feel like what I was doing mattered. Like keeping the secrets was important."</p>
            <p>"It wasn't important. It was just survival."</p>
            <p>"Sometimes survival is all there is." Margaret pulled her coat tighter against the cold. "My father used to say that. When I'd ask him why we didn't tell anyone, why we let the water stay poisoned, why we watched people get sick and didn't say anything. He'd say survival is all there is, and being good is something you do after you've survived."</p>
            <p>"Did you believe him?"</p>
            <p>"I wanted to. It was easier than the alternative." Margaret turned away from the grave, started walking toward the road. Sarah fell into step beside her. "The investigators want me to testify. Not just about Eleanor—about my father, about everyone. They want the whole history, from the beginning."</p>
            <p>"Will you do it?"</p>
            <p>"I don't have a choice anymore, do I? The files are gone, but I'm the one who read them. I'm the one who knows where all the bodies are buried." Margaret laughed, and there was no humor in it. "Literally, as it turns out. Site 7. My father used to take me fishing near there when I was little. I didn't know what was underneath us."</p>
            <p>They walked in silence through the cemetery, past graves that stretched back generations—the founding families, the fishermen, the cannery workers, all the people who had built Saltmere and lived and died without knowing what their town had become.</p>
            <p>"I keep thinking about your grandmother," Margaret said finally. "What she would have done, if she'd won. If Eleanor hadn't stopped her."</p>
            <p>"She would have told the truth."</p>
            <p>"Yes, but then what? The contamination would still have been there. The water would still have been poisoned. The town would still have been dying." Margaret shook her head. "Eleanor was right about one thing: the truth doesn't fix anything. It just changes what you know. The damage was already done before Helen Liu ever came here. All she could have done was make us look at it."</p>
            <p>"Maybe looking at it is the beginning of fixing it."</p>
            <p>"Maybe." Margaret stopped at the cemetery gate, turned to face Sarah. "What are you going to do? After all this is over?"</p>
            <p>Sarah thought about it. She'd spent so long focused on the investigation, the evidence, the endless work of documentation, that she hadn't let herself think about what came next. The research station was gone, her equipment destroyed, her original study a casualty of everything that had followed.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," she said honestly. "I came here to take samples. To write a report. To find out what happened to my grandmother. I've done all of that, or it's been done for me. But I don't feel finished."</p>
            <p>"No. I don't suppose you would." Margaret reached out, touched Sarah's arm briefly. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry. For all of it. For my father, for Eleanor, for everything this town did to your family."</p>
            <p>"It wasn't your fault."</p>
            <p>"No. But it was my inheritance. And I didn't do anything about it until it was too late to matter." Margaret walked through the gate, toward her car. "I'll see you at the courthouse. They're taking depositions next week."</p>
            <p>Sarah watched her go, then turned back to look at the cemetery. Eleanor's grave was fresh and raw, a wound in the careful green of the grass. In a year it would be covered over, grown in, indistinguishable from all the others. The land would absorb her the way the bay had absorbed everything else.</p>
            <p>But the water would remember. The contamination in the deep channel, the bodies at Site 7, the poison that had spread into the aquifer and the soil and the bones of everyone who'd ever lived here—that would remain long after Eleanor Cross was forgotten.</p>
            <p>The truth had finally risen to the surface. What came next was the long, hard work of cleaning up what it had found.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The investigation expanded through the winter.</p>
            <p>Federal agents traced the paper trail from Saltmere to Seattle to Washington, following money and contracts and careful omissions through decades of government records. Names emerged—military officials who had signed off on the disposal, corporate executives who had paid for it, politicians who had looked the other way. Grand juries were convened in three states. Indictments began to fall like dominoes.</p>
            <p>The story broke nationally on a February morning, lead headline in the New York Times: PACIFIC COAST TOWN REVEALS DECADES OF ILLEGAL DUMPING. The article quoted Sarah's research, Eleanor's deathbed testimony, Thomas's eyewitness accounts. It described Site 7 and the fourteen bodies, the military connection, the cover-up that had spanned half a century and multiple administrations.</p>
            <p>Saltmere became famous overnight. Journalists descended like gulls on garbage, filling the diner and the one motel and the streets with cameras and microphones. They wanted interviews, human interest, the story of the town that had poisoned itself to survive. They found complexity and got frustrated; they wanted villains and victims, and Saltmere gave them people who had been both.</p>
            <p>Thomas gave exactly one interview, to the Seattle Times journalist who had been there from the beginning. He talked about his father, about Eleanor, about the bones in his net and the choice he'd made to throw them back. He talked about fifty years of silence and the weight it had left on his chest. He cried, on camera, when he talked about Helen Liu—a woman he'd barely known, a woman he'd failed, a woman whose granddaughter had finally finished what she started.</p>
            <p>The interview went viral. For a few weeks, Thomas Breck was the face of Saltmere—the fisherman who had finally told the truth. People called him a hero. He didn't feel like one. He felt like a man who had waited too long to do the right thing, and was now living with the consequences of both the waiting and the doing.</p>
            <p>Margaret testified for six days. She named names, produced documents, described operations she'd only partially understood when they were happening. She testified about her father's role, Eleanor's role, her own decades of complicity. She asked for no immunity, no protection, no consideration. She simply told the truth, all of it, and let the courts decide what it meant.</p>
            <p>The EPA declared Saltmere Bay a Superfund site. The cleanup would take decades and cost hundreds of millions of dollars—money that would come from federal coffers, from corporate settlements, from the scattered remnants of Eleanor Cross's estate. The bay might never fully recover. The aquifer might be compromised forever. The town, already dying, would have to decide what kind of death it wanted: a slow fade into irrelevance, or a transformation into something new.</p>
            <p>Through all of it, Sarah stayed.</p>
            <p>She couldn't have said why, exactly. Her research was done, her questions answered, her grandmother's death finally acknowledged and documented. She had no obligations here, no roots, nothing holding her except the strange gravity of a place that had taken so much from her family.</p>
            <p>But she stayed. She testified when asked. She consulted on the cleanup efforts, offered her expertise, helped translate scientific findings for journalists and lawyers and the bewildered residents of a town that was only now learning what it had been built on.</p>
            <p>And in the quiet moments—the evenings on the dock, the mornings before the investigators arrived, the rare hours when Saltmere remembered how to be still—she thought about her grandmother. About what Helen Liu would have made of all this. About whether the truth, fifty years delayed, was better than no truth at all.</p>
            <p>She didn't have an answer. She suspected she never would.</p>
            <p>But she was here. She was still asking questions. And for now, that had to be enough.</p>
