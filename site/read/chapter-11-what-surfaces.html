        <div class="content">
            <p>They found the bodies in April, when the water warmed enough for the dive teams to work safely in the deep channel.</p>
            <p>Site 7 was exactly where Thomas remembered it—a depression in the seafloor, deeper than the surrounding terrain, sheltered from the currents that might have scattered its contents. The divers brought up drums first, rusted containers full of chemical waste that had to be handled with hazmat protocols and decontamination procedures. Then they brought up the other things. The things that had once been people.</p>
            <p>Fourteen sets of remains, according to Eleanor's records. The divers found eleven. The other three had been carried away by decades of currents, scattered across the bay floor, lost in ways that might never be recovered.</p>
            <p>Helen Liu was among the eleven.</p>
            <p>Sarah wasn't there when they brought her up. She'd asked to be called when they found anything matching her grandmother's description—a woman in her thirties, 1962, likely weighed down with something heavy—but the call came in the middle of the night, and by the time she reached the staging area the remains had already been transferred to the county coroner.</p>
            <p>She stood in the coroner's office the next morning, looking at a stainless steel table covered with what the bay had preserved: bones, mostly, stained dark by fifty years of submersion. Fragments of fabric that might have been clothing. A metal object that the coroner identified as a watch—stopped, corroded, but still recognizable as the kind of practical timepiece a scientist might have worn.</p>
            <p>"Preliminary identification is consistent with the records," the coroner said. He was a young man, too young to remember the sixties, too professional to show more than clinical interest in what lay before them. "Female, approximately thirty to forty years of age at time of death. Dental records will confirm, but based on the location and the documentation you provided, this is almost certainly Helen Liu."</p>
            <p>Sarah nodded. She'd expected to feel something—grief, relief, closure. Instead she felt hollow, as if the confirmation had emptied her of the question that had been filling her for so long.</p>
            <p>"Was there anything else? Personal effects, documents, anything she might have been carrying?"</p>
            <p>"There was a bag." The coroner moved to a separate table, pulled back a sheet. "Canvas, waterproof. Remarkably well-preserved given the circumstances. It contained papers—degraded beyond recovery—and this."</p>
            <p>He held up a small metal box, corroded but intact. Sarah took it with hands that weren't quite steady.</p>
            <p>"It was sealed," the coroner said. "We haven't opened it. I thought you might want to."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah took the box to the dock. She sat on the same coil of rope where Thomas had found her, where she'd watched the investigators arrive, where she'd spent so many hours thinking about her grandmother and the water that had swallowed her.</p>
            <p>The box was heavy for its size, solid, the kind of thing designed to survive. The seal was corroded but not broken—her grandmother had closed it expecting it to be opened again, had trusted that whatever was inside would matter to whoever found it.</p>
            <p>Sarah worked the seal with a knife, careful, patient. The metal groaned and gave way.</p>
            <p>Inside: a single sheet of paper, wrapped in oilcloth, folded into a square. The preservation was imperfect—the paper was stained, the ink faded in places—but the handwriting was clear. Precise. Scientific.</p>
            <p>A letter.</p>
            <p><em>To whoever finds this:</em></p>
            <p><em>My name is Dr. Helen Liu. I am a marine biologist with the University of Washington. I came to Saltmere to study contamination patterns in the bay, and I have discovered something that will not be allowed to remain discovered.</em></p>
            <p><em>If you are reading this, I am dead. Eleanor Cross has made it clear that my findings will not be permitted to reach the public. I have tried to negotiate, to compromise, to find a way to publish without endangering myself. I have failed. Tomorrow I will be meeting with her one final time, and I do not expect to survive.</em></p>
            <p><em>The documentation I have gathered is in the possession of a librarian named Edith Pemberton. She has made copies, and she will protect them as long as she is able. But Eleanor is patient, and she has resources I cannot match. If you are finding this letter, it is likely that the copies are gone, the evidence destroyed, the truth once again buried.</em></p>
            <p><em>I am writing this not as documentation—that exists elsewhere, or existed—but as testimony. I want someone to know that I tried. That I found the truth, that I believed it mattered, that I died for it rather than let it remain hidden.</em></p>
            <p><em>The water is poisoned. The people are sick. The families who built this town are killing it to save themselves. Someone needs to know. Someone needs to remember.</em></p>
            <p><em>If you are my daughter, reading this: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I won't be there to watch you grow up, to teach you about the ocean, to show you how beautiful the world can be when you look at it closely enough. I hope you will forgive me for choosing truth over safety. I hope you will understand that some things are worth dying for, even if the dying doesn't seem to change anything.</em></p>
            <p><em>If you are a stranger, reading this: please don't let it end here. Please find the evidence, rebuild what was destroyed, finish what I started. The truth wants to be known. It just needs someone willing to carry it.</em></p>
            <p><em>The bay remembers everything. Someday it will tell.</em></p>
            <p><em>Helen Liu</em> <em>June 15, 1962</em></p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah read the letter three times.</p>
            <p>The first time, she couldn't feel anything—the words passed through her like water through sand, leaving impressions but no substance.</p>
            <p>The second time, she felt the weight of it—fifty years of silence, fifty years of waiting, fifty years of a letter written for someone who never came. Her grandmother had written this knowing she would die. Had sealed it in a box designed to survive, had trusted that the water would keep her secrets until someone was ready to hear them.</p>
            <p>The third time, she cried.</p>
            <p>Not the clean tears of movie grief, but the ugly, gasping sobs of something breaking loose that had been held too tightly for too long. She cried for her grandmother, dead at thirty-four, her career interrupted, her life cut short because she believed truth mattered. She cried for her mother, who had grown up without ever knowing what happened, who had kept the clipping in a photo album and never spoken of it, who had carried the silence into her own grave. She cried for herself, the granddaughter who had spent six years pretending she didn't need to know, who had come to Saltmere telling herself it was about science when it was always, always about this.</p>
            <p>Thomas found her like that, as the afternoon light began to fade. He didn't say anything—just sat down beside her, handed her his handkerchief, waited.</p>
            <p>"She wrote to me," Sarah said finally, when she could speak again. "To my mother, but really to me. She knew someone would come. She knew the truth would come out."</p>
            <p>"She was right."</p>
            <p>"It took fifty years. She was dead the whole time. Edith was keeping copies in a filing cabinet, Margaret was keeping secrets in her father's study, everyone was waiting for someone else to do something, and the whole time my grandmother was down there, with this letter, waiting."</p>
            <p>"But you came."</p>
            <p>"I almost didn't." Sarah looked at the letter, the faded ink, the precise handwriting that was so much like her own. "I almost let it stay buried. I almost told myself the science was enough, that I could document the contamination without asking why, without looking at the history, without finding out what happened to her."</p>
            <p>"But you didn't."</p>
            <p>"No." Sarah folded the letter carefully, put it back in the box. "She asked whoever found this to finish what she started. To rebuild the evidence, to carry the truth." She looked at Thomas. "That's done now. The investigation, the testimony, all of it—it's done. The truth is out. The people responsible are facing consequences."</p>
            <p>"So what now?"</p>
            <p>Sarah looked out at the water, at the bay that had held her grandmother for half a century, that was only now beginning to give up its secrets. The cleanup boats were visible in the distance, moving slowly across the contaminated water, beginning the long work of remediation.</p>
            <p>"Now I figure out what I'm supposed to do next," she said. "Now that I've finished what she started."</p>
