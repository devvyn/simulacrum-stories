        <div class="content">
            <p>Margaret Holloway was at the harbor office when Sarah arrived, standing at the window that faced the water, her back to the door. She didn't turn around when Sarah entered.</p>
            <p>"I was wondering when you'd come," Margaret said. "Thomas's truck was at your station for three hours yesterday. That's not a social call."</p>
            <p>"No. It wasn't." Sarah closed the door behind her, felt the click of the latch like a punctuation mark. "He brought me something he found in the nets. A military container. Chemical disposal, World War Two era."</p>
            <p>Margaret's shoulders tightened, but she still didn't turn. "I see."</p>
            <p>"Do you?" Sarah moved to the counter, set down the folder she'd brought—Edith's copies, her own notes, photographs of the cylinder. "Because I've spent the last two days learning things about this town that I think you already know. And I'm tired of pretending we're strangers talking about weather patterns."</p>
            <p>Now Margaret did turn. Her face was composed, but something behind her eyes had shifted—a wall developing cracks, pressure building against the surface.</p>
            <p>"What is it you think I know, Dr. Chen?"</p>
            <p>"I think you know that the Saltmere Cannery was a disposal operation. Not just for industrial waste—for military surplus. Chemical weapons, biological agents, things the government wanted to disappear." Sarah opened the folder, spread the documents on the counter between them. "I think you know because your father ran it. Robert Holloway. Harbor master for thirty years, logistics coordinator for the whole operation."</p>
            <p>Margaret looked at the documents without touching them. Her hands stayed at her sides, clenched into fists she probably didn't know she was making.</p>
            <p>"Where did you get these?"</p>
            <p>"Does it matter? They exist. The evidence exists. Fifty years of manifests, payment records, correspondence. And your father's log—" Sarah pulled out the leather ledger, opened it to the marked page. "June 15th, 1962. 'Special disposal. Night operation. E.C. authorization. No manifest. Completed. Site 7.' The day before my grandmother's boat was found drifting."</p>
            <p>Margaret's face went white. Not pale—white, the color of old bone, of salt deposits on weathered wood.</p>
            <p>"Where did you find that?"</p>
            <p>"Does it matter?" Sarah repeated. "It's in his handwriting. You must have seen him write a thousand times—you know that's his script. He documented his own involvement in whatever happened that night."</p>
            <p>For a long moment, neither of them moved. The harbor office was silent except for the distant sound of boats at their moorings, the creak of wood against wood, the patient rhythm of a world that didn't care what secrets humans kept.</p>
            <p>Then Margaret walked past Sarah, went to the office door, and locked it.</p>
            <p>"Sit down," she said. Her voice was different now—lower, rougher, the professional veneer stripped away. "If we're going to do this, we're going to do it properly."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>"My father was a good man."</p>
            <p>Margaret sat across from Sarah at the small table in the back of the office, a space usually reserved for permit reviews and accident reports. Her hands were wrapped around a coffee mug she hadn't drunk from.</p>
            <p>"He was a good man who made terrible choices. That's not an excuse—it's the truth. He loved this town. He loved my mother. He loved me. And he spent thirty years poisoning the water that gave us all life because he believed there was no other way to survive."</p>
            <p>"Tell me what he believed."</p>
            <p>"He believed the cannery was all that stood between Saltmere and extinction. The fishing was already declining when he took over as harbor master—this was the fifties, the populations were already stressed, already showing signs of what was to come. The cannery employed half the town. Without it, there was nothing."</p>
            <p>"So when they offered to pay for disposal—"</p>
            <p>"He said yes. And then he kept saying yes, year after year, because once you're in that deep there's no getting out." Margaret's voice held no self-pity, only a bleak acceptance. "The money went into the town. New equipment for the fishing fleet, repairs to the pier, scholarships for kids who couldn't afford college. Everything good that happened in Saltmere for twenty years was paid for with poison."</p>
            <p>Sarah thought about that—the scholarships and the contamination, the new equipment and the military waste, everything tangled together so thoroughly that separating the good from the bad became impossible.</p>
            <p>"And Eleanor Cross?"</p>
            <p>"Eleanor was the architect. My father was just... the foreman." Margaret finally took a sip of her coffee, grimaced at its coldness. "She inherited the cannery from her husband, but the disposal operation was her idea. She had connections from the war—her husband had done something for the military, I never knew what. When the opportunity came, she saw it clearly: the bay was already compromised, the channel was deep enough to hide anything, and the town was desperate enough to stay quiet."</p>
            <p>"My grandmother found out."</p>
            <p>"Your grandmother found out." Margaret nodded slowly. "She was brilliant, Dr. Liu. I met her a few times, when I was young. She came to the harbor office to ask my father questions, and I remember thinking she was the smartest person I'd ever seen. The way she looked at things—like she could see through surfaces to what was underneath."</p>
            <p>"What did your father tell her?"</p>
            <p>"Nothing. Everything. I don't know." Margaret's composure cracked, just slightly—a tremor in her voice, a wetness at the corners of her eyes. "He never told me exactly what passed between them. But I know he was afraid. After she confronted him, he started sleeping badly. He started drinking. He kept telling my mother that it was almost over, that it would all be resolved soon."</p>
            <p>"And then she disappeared."</p>
            <p>"And then she disappeared. And my father stopped sleeping badly. And the drinking got worse instead of better. And he never mentioned her name again, not once, for the rest of his life."</p>
            <p>Sarah let the silence stretch. She'd learned, in years of fieldwork, that silence was where the truth lived—in the gaps between words, in the space people were afraid to fill.</p>
            <p>"What happened to her, Margaret?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know." The words came out strangled. "I've spent forty years not knowing. Not asking. Not looking at the boxes in my father's study, not reading the papers he left behind, not thinking about what happened the night before that woman's boat was found drifting." Margaret looked up, and her eyes were full. "I've been the harbor master for thirty years, Dr. Chen. I've inherited everything he built—the position, the responsibility, the secrets. I've kept the machine running because I didn't know how to stop it."</p>
            <p>"Do you want to stop it?"</p>
            <p>The question hung between them. Margaret set down her coffee mug, pressed her palms flat against the table.</p>
            <p>"My father had files. Documentation of everything—manifests, correspondence, maps of the disposal sites. After his stroke, I found them in his study. I was supposed to destroy them. Eleanor told me to destroy them. But I couldn't." She met Sarah's eyes. "I've kept them for fifteen years. Hidden. Insurance, I told myself. Protection. But really I think I was waiting. Waiting for someone to come who could do what I couldn't."</p>
            <p>"Let me see them."</p>
            <p>"If I give them to you—if I help you—Eleanor will know. She knows everything that happens in this town. She's been watching you since the day you arrived."</p>
            <p>"I know."</p>
            <p>"Then you know what you're asking me to risk."</p>
            <p>Sarah reached across the table, placed her hand over Margaret's. The older woman's skin was cold, her fingers rigid with tension.</p>
            <p>"I'm asking you to do what my grandmother did. To tell the truth, even though it's dangerous. Even though it might cost you everything." Sarah paused. "But I'm also asking you to trust me. I'm not going to confront Eleanor with evidence and hope for the best. My grandmother tried that, and she died for it. I'm going to build a case so complete, so irrefutable, that Eleanor won't be able to make me disappear. I'm going to bring in federal investigators, journalists, everyone I can reach. I'm going to make sure the truth gets out even if something happens to me."</p>
            <p>Margaret was quiet for a long time. Through the window, Sarah could see the harbor going about its business—boats coming and going, people working, the ordinary machinery of a town that had built its ordinary life on top of an extraordinary crime.</p>
            <p>"Come to my house tonight," Margaret said finally. "Eight o'clock. I'll give you the files."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah spent the afternoon at the research station, organizing her evidence, preparing for what was coming. She photographed every document, encrypted the files, emailed copies to three different accounts. She wrote a letter to her department head explaining what she'd found, sealed it, addressed it to be mailed only if she didn't check in within forty-eight hours.</p>
            <p>Paranoid precautions. But her grandmother hadn't been paranoid enough.</p>
            <p>By seven-thirty she was in her car, driving through the fog toward Margaret's house on the hill above the harbor. The roads were empty, the streetlights haloed in moisture, the world reduced to the tunnel of her headlights and the gray beyond.</p>
            <p>She found the house dark.</p>
            <p>Not just dim—dark. No lights in any window, no porch light, no indication that anyone was home or expecting a visitor. Sarah sat in her car for a moment, watching, waiting for some sign of movement.</p>
            <p>Nothing.</p>
            <p>She got out, walked to the front door, knocked. The sound echoed strangely, as if the house were empty. She tried the handle.</p>
            <p>The door swung open.</p>
            <p>Inside, chaos. Furniture overturned, drawers pulled out and dumped, papers scattered across the floor like fallen leaves. Someone had torn through the house with violent efficiency, searching for something specific, leaving destruction in their wake.</p>
            <p>"Margaret?" Sarah's voice came out wrong—thin, frightened. "Margaret, are you here?"</p>
            <p>She found her in the study, sitting in a chair by the empty filing cabinet, staring at nothing. Not hurt—not physically. But something had broken in her face, some last piece of hope or resistance.</p>
            <p>"They're gone," Margaret said. "The files. Forty years of documentation. All of it." She looked at Sarah, and her eyes were the eyes of someone who had just watched the last door close. "She knew. Eleanor knew. She always knows."</p>
            <p>Sarah stood in the ransacked study, surrounded by the debris of Margaret's failed courage, and felt the shape of the thing she was fighting become clearer.</p>
            <p>Eleanor Cross had been doing this for fifty years. She had survived Helen Liu's investigation, Robert Holloway's guilt, decades of accumulated evidence. She had done it by knowing everything, by moving first, by eliminating threats before they could become dangers.</p>
            <p>And now she knew about Sarah.</p>
