        <div class="content">
            <p>Three months later, the fog lifted.</p>
            <p>Not permanently—fog was part of Saltmere's nature, part of its geography and climate and soul—but on this particular morning in early summer, Sarah woke to sunlight. Real sunlight, not the gray diffusion that usually passed for daylight here, but actual rays slanting through the window of the small house she'd rented on the hill above the harbor.</p>
            <p>She'd stayed. She couldn't quite explain why, even to herself. The investigation was essentially over; the evidence had been gathered, the testimony given, the wheels of justice grinding slowly but inevitably forward. There was nothing holding her here except her own stubborn refusal to leave.</p>
            <p>Maybe it was the work. The EPA had offered her a consulting position on the cleanup effort—not permanent, but enough to justify staying, enough to give her days structure and purpose. She spent her mornings on boats, taking samples, monitoring progress, tracking the slow retreat of contamination from the waters her grandmother had first come to study.</p>
            <p>Maybe it was the people. Thomas had become something like a friend—not close, not warm, but solid in the way of people who had been through something together. He still fished, though the catches remained sparse, the populations too depleted to recover quickly. He talked about retiring, sometimes, about selling the boat and moving somewhere the water wasn't poisoned. He never did.</p>
            <p>Maybe it was the need to see it through. Her grandmother had come here looking for answers and found death instead. Sarah had come looking for death and found answers. Leaving before the story was really finished felt like abandoning something she'd promised to carry.</p>
            <p>She made coffee, dressed, walked down to the harbor in the unfamiliar brightness. The town was stirring—slowly, tentatively, the way a patient stirs after a long illness. Some things had changed. The cannery had been demolished, its ruins cleared away by federal cleanup crews, the land designated for remediation and eventual redevelopment. Eleanor's general store had been sold to a young couple from Portland who talked about organic produce and community gathering spaces. The diner had new owners too, and new hours, and a menu that included things no one in Saltmere had ever asked for.</p>
            <p>Other things remained. The fishing boats still went out each morning, even if they came back with less. The church still rang its bells on Sunday. The older families still gathered at the hardware store to talk about weather and politics and the strange new world their town had become.</p>
            <p>And Margaret Holloway was still the harbor master.</p>
            <p>Sarah found her in the office, as she always was, surrounded by tide charts and permit applications and the endless paperwork of keeping a harbor running. Margaret looked different than she had six months ago—thinner, grayer, but also somehow lighter, as if the weight she'd been carrying had finally been set down.</p>
            <p>"Dr. Chen." Margaret looked up from her desk. "Coffee?"</p>
            <p>"I have some. Thank you." Sarah settled into the chair across from her, the same chair where she'd first heard Margaret's careful evasions, where she'd later heard her confession. "The memorial committee wants to finalize the design. They asked me to get your approval."</p>
            <p>Margaret took the folder Sarah offered, leafed through the sketches inside. A simple stone marker, to be placed on the waterfront near the old cannery site. Fourteen names, each one a person who had died because they asked too many questions. Helen Liu would be seventh on the list, as she had been seventh in Eleanor's ledger.</p>
            <p>"It's good," Margaret said quietly. "Dignified. Not too dramatic."</p>
            <p>"That was the idea."</p>
            <p>"My father's name won't be on it. The people responsible—the ones who did the killing, not the ones who were killed." Margaret closed the folder. "I thought about asking. Thought about making the case that he was a victim too, in his way. Trapped by circumstances, by Eleanor, by the choices he'd made before he understood what they meant."</p>
            <p>"But you didn't."</p>
            <p>"No. Because it wouldn't be true. He wasn't a victim. He was a participant." Margaret's voice was steady, matter-of-fact—the voice of someone who had spent months testifying to her father's crimes, who had made peace with the truth even if she hadn't made peace with herself. "He made choices. They were the wrong choices. I spent my whole life pretending that didn't matter, that loyalty was the same as love. It wasn't."</p>
            <p>"For what it's worth, I think he would have been proud of what you did. The testimony. The cooperation. Choosing to tell the truth."</p>
            <p>"Maybe." Margaret smiled, thin and tired. "Or maybe he would have been horrified. I'll never know. That's the thing about the dead—they don't get to update their opinions."</p>
            <p>She handed the folder back to Sarah.</p>
            <p>"Approve whatever design you want. I trust you."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The memorial was dedicated on the anniversary of Helen Liu's death—June 16th, fifty-one years after she disappeared.</p>
            <p>The town gathered on the waterfront, in the shadow of where the cannery had stood, in the sunlight that seemed determined to stay for just this day. Federal officials attended, and journalists, and representatives from the families whose loved ones were named on the stone. Edith Pemberton sat in a wheelchair at the front, ninety-two years old, alive to see the truth she'd protected finally carved in granite.</p>
            <p>Thomas stood at the back, as he always stood, alone and apart, watching with eyes that had seen too much to look away.</p>
            <p>Sarah was asked to speak. She hadn't prepared remarks—had told herself she would find the words when the moment came, the way scientists find conclusions after gathering enough data. But standing in front of the crowd, in front of the stone with her grandmother's name, she found that she didn't need words at all.</p>
            <p>"She believed truth mattered," Sarah said. "That was her crime, and her gift, and the thing that killed her. She believed that if people knew—if they really understood what was happening to this water, to this town, to themselves—they would choose to do the right thing. She was wrong about that, at least in the short term. The people who knew chose silence. The people who could have helped chose safety. The truth she died for stayed buried for fifty years."</p>
            <p>She paused, looked out at the faces in the crowd. Townspeople who had grown up drinking poisoned water, breathing contaminated air, building their lives on foundations of secrecy and denial. They looked back at her with expressions she couldn't quite read—shame, maybe, or gratitude, or the complicated mix of both that came from finally seeing yourself clearly.</p>
            <p>"But she wasn't entirely wrong," Sarah continued. "The truth did matter. It mattered enough that Edith kept copies for half a century. It mattered enough that Thomas finally told what he knew. It mattered enough that Eleanor Cross, on her deathbed, chose to speak rather than stay silent. The truth my grandmother died for didn't stay buried forever. It just waited. Waited for the right moment, the right people, the right combination of courage and circumstance."</p>
            <p>She touched the stone, felt the names carved into it, the weight of fourteen lives reduced to letters and dates.</p>
            <p>"We're here to remember them. Not just as victims—though they were that—but as people who chose truth over safety, who believed the right thing to do was worth doing even when it was dangerous. They were wrong about how long it would take. They were wrong about whether they would survive. But they were right about what mattered."</p>
            <p>Sarah stepped back from the stone. The crowd was silent. Somewhere a gull called, and the water lapped against the pilings, and the world went on being the world regardless of what humans did or didn't say about it.</p>
            <p>"The bay remembers everything," Sarah said. "That's what my grandmother wrote, in a letter she never expected anyone to read. The bay remembers everything. Someday it will tell."</p>
            <p>She gestured toward the water, toward the cleanup boats visible in the distance, toward the slow ongoing work of remediation and healing.</p>
            <p>"Someday is now."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>After the ceremony, after the reporters had gone and the officials had returned to their offices and the townspeople had drifted back to their lives, Sarah walked to the end of the dock. The same dock where she'd arrived six months ago, lost in fog and uncertainty, carrying questions she hadn't known how to ask.</p>
            <p>Thomas joined her, as he often did. They stood together watching the water, the light, the boats moving slowly across the bay.</p>
            <p>"What's next?" he asked. "The cleanup's going to take years. Are you staying for all of it?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know." Sarah looked at him, at the weathered face and ice-water eyes that had become familiar. "I came here to finish what my grandmother started. I've done that. The truth is out, the investigation is over, the memorial is built. There's nothing holding me here anymore."</p>
            <p>"But you're not leaving."</p>
            <p>"Not yet." She turned back to the water. "I think I need to figure out what I'm starting before I can figure out when to leave. My grandmother came here to study contamination and found conspiracy. I came here to find conspiracy and found..." She paused, searching for the word. "Family. Not the genetic kind—or not just that. The kind you build by going through something together."</p>
            <p>"Saltmere isn't much of a family."</p>
            <p>"No. But it's honest now. Or trying to be." Sarah smiled, the first genuine smile she'd felt in months. "That's something. That's a start."</p>
            <p>Thomas pulled out a cigarette, lit it, watched the smoke curl up into the clear air.</p>
            <p>"Your grandmother would have liked this," he said. "The sunlight. The cleanup. The town finally telling the truth." He took a long drag. "She would have liked you."</p>
            <p>"You think so?"</p>
            <p>"I know so. She had the same look you have—like she could see through things to what was underneath." He exhaled smoke. "The difference is, you survived. You got to see how the story ends."</p>
            <p>"The story doesn't end. It just changes."</p>
            <p>"Yeah." Thomas stubbed out his cigarette, pocketed the butt. "I guess it does."</p>
            <p>They stood together a while longer, watching the light move across the water, the boats doing their slow work, the town behind them stirring into whatever it was becoming. The fog would come back—it always did—but for now the bay was clear, and bright, and full of the kind of terrible beauty that came from finally seeing something true.</p>
            <p>The tide was going out. The water was receding, revealing what had been hidden, exposing the bones of the bay to the unfamiliar light.</p>
            <p>Sarah watched it go, and didn't look away.</p>
