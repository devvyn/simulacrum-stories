        <div class="content">
            <p>Thomas Breck's boat was called <em>Nothing Personal</em>, which Sarah suspected was either a joke or a warning. It was a working vessel, not a charter—scarred wood, diesel exhaust, nets coiled in the stern like sleeping snakes—and it sat low in the water as if it had grown tired of floating and was considering other options.</p>
            <p>"Watch your step," Thomas said, not offering a hand as she climbed aboard. "The deck's slick."</p>
            <p>The deck was slick. Sarah had worn the wrong shoes—field boots meant for marshland, not a pitching boat—and she grabbed the gunwale harder than dignity would have preferred. Thomas pretended not to notice, which she appreciated more than help.</p>
            <p>The fog had lifted overnight, replaced by the kind of gray overcast that made the water and sky the same color, the horizon a seam you had to take on faith. Sarah set her equipment cases in the spot Thomas indicated and checked her GPS unit, watching the coordinates flicker into certainty.</p>
            <p>"The deep channel first," she said. "That's where the anomalous readings are concentrated."</p>
            <p>Thomas started the engine without comment. The boat shuddered, coughed, found its rhythm. They pulled away from the dock, and Sarah watched Saltmere shrink behind them—the waterfront buildings, the church steeple, the dark mass of the old cannery hunched against the treeline like something waiting.</p>
            <p>"How long have you been fishing these waters?" she asked, once the engine noise had settled into something she could talk over.</p>
            <p>"Forty-three years." Thomas kept his eyes on the water ahead, reading currents she couldn't see. "Started when I was nine. My father would take me out on mornings like this, before school. Said the fish were smarter than the teachers anyway."</p>
            <p>"Were they?"</p>
            <p>The corner of his mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but its acknowledgment. "The fish are gone now, so I suppose we'll never know."</p>
            <p>The boat moved through water the color of old pewter, past buoys marking territories Sarah didn't understand, past a cluster of other fishing boats that Thomas raised a hand to but didn't approach. She noticed how the other fishermen watched her—the same assessing stillness she'd felt from Eleanor Cross, from the town itself. She was being weighed, measured, found not quite one thing or another.</p>
            <p>"The catches," Sarah said. "When did they start declining?"</p>
            <p>"Depends who you ask. The old-timers say it was the cannery closing that did it—no more processing meant no more markets, meant no reason to fish hard. But that's not right." Thomas adjusted their course slightly, steering around something she couldn't see. "The cannery closed because the fish were already going. Cause and effect, Dr. Chen. People get them backward when the truth is inconvenient."</p>
            <p>"And the contamination?"</p>
            <p>Thomas was quiet for a long moment. The engine hummed. The water slapped against the hull in a rhythm that was almost meditative.</p>
            <p>"When I was a boy," he said finally, "you could see twenty feet down on a clear day. The water was green, not gray. There were kelp beds along the shore thick enough to hide in." He shook his head slowly. "My grandson will never see that. Never know it was possible."</p>
            <p>"You have a grandson?"</p>
            <p>"Had. He moved to Portland with his mother after my son's divorce. Visits summers, sometimes. When he remembers." Thomas's voice was flat, a door closing. "The water changed first. Then the fish. Then the people. All in that order, and all for the same reason."</p>
            <p>"What reason?"</p>
            <p>But Thomas had retreated into silence, and Sarah knew better than to push. She'd learned that rhythm in a dozen fishing communities—the way information came in tides, the way forcing it only drove it deeper. She turned her attention to the water instead, watching the GPS as they approached the deep channel.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The channel was a natural trench in the bay floor, a scar left by some ancient geological violence that had carved the bedrock into a chasm. Sarah's preliminary readings had shown contamination concentrations there that were orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the bay—metals and industrial compounds that didn't match the expected footprint of a fishing community, no matter how hard she tried to make the numbers fit.</p>
            <p>"Here," Thomas said, cutting the engine. They drifted in sudden silence, the boat rocking gently, the shore a distant suggestion. "This is where the channel drops. Three hundred feet to the bottom, if you can call it a bottom. More like a throat."</p>
            <p>Sarah assembled her sampling equipment with practiced efficiency: the Niskin bottles for water collection, the sediment corer, the portable spectrometer that would give her preliminary readings in the field. Thomas watched her work without offering to help—not rudeness, she understood, but the respect of one professional for another's tools.</p>
            <p>She lowered the first sampler over the side, watching the cable unspool into water that seemed to swallow light. The winch creaked. The boat tilted slightly with the weight.</p>
            <p>"Careful," Thomas said. "Current's tricky in the channel. Gets things moving in ways you don't expect."</p>
            <p>"What kinds of things?"</p>
            <p>He didn't answer. Sarah retrieved the first sample, sealed it, labeled it with coordinates and depth. The water in the bottle looked wrong—a faint iridescence that shouldn't have been there, a rainbow sheen that spoke of petroleum compounds or something worse.</p>
            <p>"I'm going to need multiple samples at different depths," she said. "And sediment cores, if the bottom is accessible."</p>
            <p>"It's accessible." Thomas lit a cigarette, cupping his hands against a wind that barely existed. "Whether you want to access it is another question."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
            <p>He exhaled smoke that hung in the still air like a ghost. "When I was sixteen, seventeen maybe, there was another researcher. Before your time, before mine really—I was just a kid working my father's boat. A woman from the university, like you. Came to study the water."</p>
            <p>Sarah's hands went still on the sampling equipment. Her heart had become very loud.</p>
            <p>"What happened to her?"</p>
            <p>"She took samples in this exact spot. Day after day, week after week. Built up a collection, ran her tests." Thomas's eyes were fixed on the water, on the past. "And then one day she didn't come back to the harbor. Her boat was found drifting, empty, out past the point. They searched for three days. Never found anything."</p>
            <p>"Do you remember her name?"</p>
            <p>Thomas took a long drag on his cigarette. The silence stretched.</p>
            <p>"Liu," he said finally. "Dr. Liu. She was young, younger than you. Pretty, in a serious way. She asked questions—not just about the water, about the town, about the old families. About things people didn't want to remember." He looked at Sarah then, and his ice-water eyes held something she couldn't quite name—warning, maybe, or grief, or both. "You look like her, you know. Around the eyes. The way you hold your shoulders when you're concentrating."</p>
            <p>"She was my grandmother."</p>
            <p>The words came out before Sarah could stop them—the truth she'd carried across three thousand miles and six years of pretending it didn't matter. Thomas didn't look surprised. He just nodded slowly, as if confirming something he'd already suspected.</p>
            <p>"I wondered," he said. "When Margaret told me a Dr. Chen was coming to study contamination, I wondered. The coincidences stack up a certain way sometimes."</p>
            <p>"What happened to her, Thomas? Not the official story—the true one."</p>
            <p>He stubbed out his cigarette against the gunwale, carefully, and pocketed the butt. When he spoke again, his voice was quieter, stripped of its weathered performance.</p>
            <p>"I don't know the true story. Nobody does, or nobody who's talking. But I know she found something—something in this channel, something in her samples. And I know that the week before she disappeared, she had a meeting with Eleanor Cross. I was at the harbor, mending nets. I saw them together in Eleanor's car, talking for nearly an hour." He met Sarah's eyes. "A week later, Dr. Liu was gone. A month later, every record of her research had vanished from the town archives. Coincidence doesn't stack that way by accident."</p>
            <p>The boat rocked gently in the current. Somewhere overhead, a gull called—a lonely sound, accusatory somehow.</p>
            <p>"I'm going to find out what happened to her," Sarah said.</p>
            <p>"I know you are." Thomas started the engine again. "The question is what it's going to cost you. What it's going to cost all of us."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>They spent three more hours on the water, working methodically through Sarah's sample sites. She collected water from six depths, sediment from two accessible points on the channel floor, control samples from the shallower bay for comparison. Her spectrometer readings confirmed what she'd suspected: contamination levels that exceeded anything she'd seen in twenty years of environmental work. Heavy metals, petroleum compounds, and something else—organic signatures that didn't match any expected profile.</p>
            <p>Thomas said little, but he watched everything. When she struggled with a stubborn sediment core, he was there with a steadying hand. When the current shifted unexpectedly, he adjusted their position before she had to ask. A partnership forming in silence, the way partnerships form when both parties understand the stakes.</p>
            <p>By early afternoon, the overcast had begun to thin, allowing pale sunlight to filter through—not warmth exactly, but the promise of it. Sarah packed her equipment carefully, her mind already sorting through the analysis she'd need to run, the comparisons she'd need to make.</p>
            <p>"The library," Thomas said, as they approached the dock. "You should check the library."</p>
            <p>"The town library?"</p>
            <p>"Such as it is. There's a back room, archives they don't advertise. Old newspapers, county records, things that got forgotten because nobody thought they mattered." He guided the boat alongside the dock with practiced precision. "Mrs. Pemberton runs it—she's eighty if she's a day, and she remembers everything. Everything and everyone."</p>
            <p>"Including my grandmother?"</p>
            <p>Thomas secured the lines before answering. "Including your grandmother. She was the one who helped Dr. Liu with her research back then. Found documents, old maps, things the town didn't want found." He met Sarah's eyes one last time. "She never forgave herself for what happened. Maybe talking to you would help. Maybe it would make things worse. Either way, she's the door you need to knock on."</p>
            <p>He helped her transfer her equipment to the dock without another word, and Sarah stood watching as <em>Nothing Personal</em> pulled away, heading back out toward the open water. Thomas didn't look back. He didn't wave.</p>
            <p>But she understood now why he'd helped her, why he'd told her what he knew. Some debts couldn't be paid by the people who'd incurred them. They had to be inherited, passed down through generations like the contamination in the water, until someone finally chose to face them.</p>
            <p>Sarah gathered her sample cases and walked toward town, toward the library, toward whatever Mrs. Pemberton could tell her about a woman who'd died fifty years ago asking the same questions she was asking now.</p>
            <p>The fog was returning, creeping in from the horizon like a slow tide.</p>
