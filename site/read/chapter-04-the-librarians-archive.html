        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The Saltmere Public Library occupied half of a building that had once been a Grange hall, the other half given over to a thrift shop run by the Methodist women's auxiliary. Sarah found it by following Thomas's directions—"past the diner, left at the flagpole, look for the building that can't decide what it wants to be"—and stood for a moment on the sidewalk, studying the facade.</p>
            <p>The library half had tall windows, institutionally clean, with a modest sign declaring its hours: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 10-4. The thrift shop half had windows cluttered with donations nobody wanted—a brass floor lamp, a portrait of someone's ancestor, a taxidermied owl that watched Sarah with glass eyes full of accusations.</p>
            <p>It was Thursday. The door was unlocked.</p>
            <p>Inside, the smell of old paper and older dust, the particular silence of places where words go to wait. The main room was small—four reading tables, a circulation desk, shelves lining every wall and subdividing the space into alcoves. Sarah had been in university libraries that contained more books in a single aisle, but something about the density here suggested depth. These weren't books that had been bought in bulk and catalogued by algorithm. These were books that had accumulated, each one arriving by its own path, staying because someone thought it mattered.</p>
            <p>"You must be the researcher."</p>
            <p>The woman who emerged from behind a shelf was small and white-haired, her face a geography of wrinkles that somehow suggested alertness rather than age. She wore a cardigan the color of autumn leaves and glasses on a beaded chain, and she moved with the careful economy of someone who had learned not to waste motion.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Pemberton?" Sarah guessed.</p>
            <p>"Just Edith. Mrs. Pemberton was my mother-in-law, and she's been dead forty years, which is long enough to stop invoking her." The old woman's eyes—sharp, assessing—traveled over Sarah's face. "Thomas called ahead. Said you'd be coming to ask about the past."</p>
            <p>"I'm studying the contamination in the bay. I thought historical records might help me understand—"</p>
            <p>"You're studying your grandmother." Edith Pemberton's voice was gentle but unyielding. "Let's not pretend otherwise. It wastes time, and I don't have as much of that as I used to."</p>
            <p>Sarah felt the careful architecture of her cover story crumble. "You knew her."</p>
            <p>"I helped her." Edith moved toward the circulation desk, gesturing for Sarah to follow. "Fifty years ago, when I was the junior librarian and Helen Liu was the first real scientist this town had ever seen. She came in asking for historical records—land surveys, county assessments, business filings. I thought she was writing a dissertation. It took me two weeks to understand she was building a case."</p>
            <p>"A case against whom?"</p>
            <p>Edith settled into the chair behind the desk and looked at Sarah for a long moment. Something moved in her expression—memory, maybe, or the weight of decisions made long ago.</p>
            <p>"Sit down, Dr. Chen. This isn't a standing-up conversation."</p>
            <p>Sarah sat. The chair was old, wooden, uncomfortable in ways that suggested intention—a library chair designed to keep patrons awake and reading. Edith folded her hands on the desk, her fingers knotted with arthritis but steady.</p>
            <p>"Your grandmother was brilliant," she said. "And careful. And completely unprepared for what she found." She paused. "Do you know what the Saltmere Cannery processed, besides fish?"</p>
            <p>"I assumed—"</p>
            <p>"Everyone assumed. That was the point." Edith's voice had dropped, reflexively, though they were alone in the library. "The cannery was a front. Oh, they processed fish—enough to maintain appearances, enough to employ the town. But the real business was disposal. Industrial waste from factories up and down the coast. Chemical companies, manufacturers, anyone willing to pay to make their problems disappear."</p>
            <p>Sarah felt the floor shift beneath her, the careful framework of her research reorganizing itself around a different center of gravity. "The contamination readings. The heavy metals, the compounds that don't match local industry—"</p>
            <p>"—come from everywhere. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco. Fifty years of poison, Dr. Chen, shipped in by rail and truck and dumped in the deep channel under cover of a fishing operation." Edith's eyes were bright with old anger. "Your grandmother found the manifests. Shipping records, payment ledgers, correspondence with the disposal clients. She built a paper trail that would have brought down the Cross family and half the county government."</p>
            <p>"What happened to it?"</p>
            <p>"The same thing that happened to her." Edith's voice went flat. "It disappeared. The week before she vanished, she told me she was going to confront Eleanor Cross with the evidence. I begged her not to. I said these people have been burying secrets for generations, and they won't stop at paper." The old woman's hands tightened on each other. "She didn't listen. She was young, and she believed in truth the way young people do—like it was a weapon that couldn't misfire."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Edith led Sarah to the back room—a space that had once been a storage closet, now lined with filing cabinets and cardboard boxes, the accumulated sediment of a town that had never quite figured out what to throw away.</p>
            <p>"The official records are in the county courthouse," Edith said, pulling open a drawer. "But the unofficial ones—the things people donated when they cleaned out attics, the documents that didn't fit anywhere else—those ended up here. I've been the unofficial archivist for forty years. Unofficial means nobody audits me."</p>
            <p>She pulled out a folder, thick with age, and handed it to Sarah.</p>
            <p>"Helen's research. What I managed to save."</p>
            <p>Sarah opened the folder with hands that weren't quite steady. Inside: photocopies of shipping manifests, faded but legible. Handwritten notes in precise, scientific script. A map of the bay with depths marked and locations circled—the deep channel, the cannery pier, other sites Sarah didn't recognize.</p>
            <p>"These are copies," she said.</p>
            <p>"The originals went with Helen. I made duplicates in secret, one page at a time, on the library's mimeograph machine. It took me three months." Edith's voice held no pride, only grief. "After she disappeared, I was terrified they'd come for these too. I hid them behind the genealogy records. Nobody in Saltmere wants to look too closely at their family trees."</p>
            <p>Sarah turned pages, scanning names and numbers, the language of commerce dressed up as ordinary business. <em>Shipment received, 400 drums, contents as specified. Payment remitted per agreement. Disposal confirmed.</em></p>
            <p>"Who else knows about these?"</p>
            <p>"No one living. Thomas knows I know something, but he's never asked what. Margaret Holloway suspects—her father was the one who coordinated the shipments, and she's spent her whole life managing what he left behind." Edith's face hardened. "And Eleanor Cross knows everything. She always has."</p>
            <p>Sarah looked up from the folder. "Thomas said my grandmother met with Eleanor. The week before she vanished."</p>
            <p>"She did. In Eleanor's car, at the harbor. I watched from the library window." Edith moved to the room's single small window, looking out at nothing. "They talked for nearly an hour. When Helen got out, she was pale. Shaking. She came here afterward, asked me to keep the copies safe. Said she'd found something worse than the dumping—something Eleanor would kill to protect."</p>
            <p>"What was it?"</p>
            <p>"She never told me. She said the less I knew, the safer I'd be." Edith turned back to Sarah, and her eyes were wet. "Three days later, her boat was found drifting empty. They called it an accident. Everyone knew it wasn't. Everyone stayed silent anyway."</p>
            <p>"Why?"</p>
            <p>"Because Eleanor Cross owns this town, Dr. Chen. Not just the land and the businesses—the people. Their mortgages, their secrets, their children's futures. Speaking up meant losing everything. So nobody spoke." Edith's voice cracked. "I've kept these copies for fifty years. I've watched the water die and the fish disappear and the truth rot in a filing cabinet because I was too afraid to do what Helen did."</p>
            <p>Sarah closed the folder. The weight of it—paper and secrets and half a century of silence—settled into her hands like an inheritance.</p>
            <p>"I'm not afraid," she said.</p>
            <p>"You should be." Edith reached out and touched Sarah's arm, her grip surprisingly strong. "Your grandmother wasn't afraid either. That's why she's dead."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah spent three hours in the back room, photographing documents with her phone, taking notes, building the framework of understanding that her grandmother had constructed fifty years ago. The evidence was fragmentary—Edith's copies represented only a fraction of what Helen had gathered—but the pattern was clear enough.</p>
            <p>The Saltmere Cannery had operated as a disposal site for at least two decades. The waste had come from industrial sources across the Pacific Northwest. The payments had flowed through shell companies and false accounts into the pockets of the Cross family and their associates. And when Helen Liu had threatened to expose it all, she had been silenced.</p>
            <p>What Sarah didn't find was what Helen had discovered in that final week—the thing "worse than the dumping" that Eleanor would kill to protect. The copies stopped abruptly, the paper trail going cold at the moment it mattered most.</p>
            <p>"There's one more thing," Edith said, as Sarah prepared to leave. She handed over a slim volume—a bound ledger, leather-covered, small enough to fit in a coat pocket.</p>
            <p>"What is this?"</p>
            <p>"The harbor master's log, 1962. June specifically." Edith's voice was barely a whisper. "Robert Holloway's own handwriting. I found it in a box of donated materials fifteen years ago. Someone's estate sale—I never learned whose."</p>
            <p>Sarah opened the ledger. The pages were filled with the mundane details of harbor operations: tides, vessels, weather conditions. She flipped to June, scanning for anything significant.</p>
            <p>And stopped.</p>
            <p>June 15th, 1962. The day before Helen Liu's boat was found. An entry in careful script:</p>
            <p><em>Special disposal. Night operation. E.C. authorization. No manifest.</em></p>
            <p>Below it, in different ink, added later:</p>
            <p><em>Completed. Site 7.</em></p>
            <p>Sarah looked at Edith. "Site 7?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. It's not on any map I've found." The old woman's face was gray. "But I know what <em>special disposal</em> means. And I know what requires Eleanor Cross's personal authorization."</p>
            <p>Sarah closed the ledger. Her hands were shaking.</p>
            <p>"I need to find Site 7."</p>
            <p>"I know you do." Edith took Sarah's hands in hers, holding tight. "Just remember what I said. Your grandmother believed truth was enough. It wasn't. Whatever you find out there, make sure you have more than truth before you use it."</p>
            <p>Sarah walked out of the library into afternoon light that felt too bright, too ordinary for what she now carried. The thrift shop owl watched her go with its glass eyes, and she thought she understood now why someone had donated it: some things were easier to give away than to keep looking at.</p>
            <p>She had her grandmother's research. She had the harbor master's confession, written in his own hand. She had a location—Site 7—that might hold answers to questions fifty years old.</p>
            <p>What she didn't have was a way to find it without Eleanor Cross knowing.</p>
            <p>But she was going to try anyway.</p>
