        <div class="content">
            <p>Thomas found her on the dock at midnight, sitting on a coil of rope with her arms wrapped around her knees, staring at the water like it might give her answers.</p>
            <p>"Heard about the station," he said, settling beside her. His joints protested the cold, the damp, the accumulated insults of seventy years, but he ignored them. "Margaret called. Said you might need somewhere to stay."</p>
            <p>"I need more than somewhere to stay." Sarah's voice was flat, exhausted. "They took everything. Samples, equipment, backup drives. Everything I hadn't already sent out."</p>
            <p>"But you did send things out."</p>
            <p>"Copies. To three different addresses, encrypted, with instructions." She laughed, and there was no humor in it. "I thought I was being smart. I thought I was learning from my grandmother's mistakes. But Eleanor knew. She knew, and she still invited me to tea and told me her whole sad story while her people cleaned out my station."</p>
            <p>Thomas was quiet for a moment, listening to the water lap against the pilings, the distant creak of boats at their moorings. The fog had lifted slightly, revealing a sky thick with stars—more stars than the mainland ever saw, the one gift of a town too small and poor for light pollution.</p>
            <p>"She didn't tell you everything," he said finally.</p>
            <p>"No. She told me enough to make me doubt, and she let me think I was winning while she took away everything I needed to win." Sarah turned to look at him. "I walked into it. Sat in her rocking chair, drank her tea, listened to her justify fifty years of silence. And I thought I was being brave."</p>
            <p>"You were being brave. That's different from being smart." Thomas pulled out a cigarette, lit it, let the smoke curl up into the darkness. "Eleanor's been outsmarting people for longer than you've been alive. The question isn't whether she beat you today. The question is what you do tomorrow."</p>
            <p>"What can I do? Without evidence, without samples, without proof—I'm just a woman with a story. Stories don't hold up in court. Stories don't trigger federal investigations."</p>
            <p>"Then we get more evidence."</p>
            <p>Sarah's head turned sharply. "Where?"</p>
            <p>Thomas took a long drag on his cigarette, let the smoke out slowly. He'd been thinking about this since Margaret's call, turning it over in his mind like a stone in his pocket. The thing he'd avoided for fifty-six years. The place that lived in his nightmares.</p>
            <p>"The cannery," he said. "Nobody's been inside since it closed in sixty-eight. Eleanor keeps it locked, pays someone to maintain it just enough to keep it standing. She says it's for safety—unstable structures, hazardous materials. But I've seen her go in there, late at night, when she thinks nobody's watching."</p>
            <p>"What's inside?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. But whatever your grandmother found, whatever was bad enough to get her killed—it wasn't in the files Margaret kept, and it wasn't in the documents Edith saved. It was something else. Something Eleanor's been protecting for fifty years." He stubbed out his cigarette on the dock. "The cannery's the only place left we haven't looked."</p>
            <p>Sarah was quiet. He could see her thinking, weighing risks against possibilities, calculating odds the way scientists did.</p>
            <p>"How do we get in?"</p>
            <p>"There's a service entrance on the water side. The lock's rusted through—I checked, years ago, when I was drunk enough to be curious and sober enough to lose my nerve." Thomas stood, felt his knees crack. "If you want to go, we go tonight. If we wait, Eleanor will hear about it, and whatever's in there will disappear like everything else."</p>
            <p>Sarah stood too. In the starlight, she looked younger than she was, and older—the strange compression of age that happened when someone faced something larger than themselves.</p>
            <p>"Let's go," she said.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The cannery loomed against the sky like a beached ship, its smokestacks cold and silent, its windows dark eyes staring out at the water. In its operating days it had processed millions of pounds of fish, employed half the town, been the beating heart of Saltmere's economy. Now it was a monument to everything that had gone wrong—the declining catches, the poisoned water, the industry that had eaten itself from the inside.</p>
            <p>They approached from the water side, keeping to the shadows, listening for any sound that might indicate a patrol or an alarm. There was nothing. The cannery sat in absolute stillness, forgotten by everything except the salt air slowly eating its bones.</p>
            <p>The service entrance was where Thomas remembered it—a heavy metal door at the base of the building, half-hidden by overgrown vegetation and decades of accumulated debris. The lock was a padlock, and it had rusted nearly through; Thomas broke it with a tire iron he'd brought from his truck, the snap of metal loud in the silence.</p>
            <p>Inside, darkness. The smell of rust and old fish and something else—chemical, acrid, wrong. Thomas switched on his flashlight, and the beam carved a tunnel through the black.</p>
            <p>"Stay close," he said. "These floors haven't been maintained in thirty years."</p>
            <p>They moved through the processing hall, past machines that had once worked in mechanical symphony, now silent and corroded, their gears frozen, their conveyor belts rotted to scraps. Everything was smaller than Thomas remembered from his one childhood visit—the great machines reduced by time and memory to something almost pathetic, like the skeleton of a whale too long on the beach.</p>
            <p>"This way." He led Sarah toward the administrative section, where the offices had been, where the records would have been kept. The building groaned around them, settling into its decay, protesting the intrusion.</p>
            <p>The main office was a ruin—furniture overturned, papers scattered and rotted, everything that might have been useful long since destroyed by water and time and deliberate neglect. Sarah photographed it anyway, her phone's flash illuminating corners that hadn't seen light in decades.</p>
            <p>"There's nothing here," she said. "Nothing usable."</p>
            <p>"Not here." Thomas shone his light toward the back of the room, where a metal door stood slightly ajar—a door he'd never seen before, in all his memories of this building. "But I think there's more."</p>
            <p>The door opened onto stairs leading down. A basement. In a building that, as far as Thomas had ever known, didn't have a basement.</p>
            <p>"I didn't know this was here," he said quietly.</p>
            <p>"Neither did anyone else, I think." Sarah was already starting down the stairs. "That's the point."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The basement was concrete and steel, newer construction than the building above—probably added decades after the original cannery was built, probably at the same time the disposal operation began. The flashlight beams revealed a long corridor with doors on either side, each door labeled with numbers that meant nothing to Thomas.</p>
            <p>"Storage rooms," Sarah said. "Climate-controlled, by the look of the ventilation. Someone spent serious money building this."</p>
            <p>They tried the first door. Locked. The second. Locked. The third swung open when Sarah pushed, and Thomas heard her breath catch.</p>
            <p>Inside: filing cabinets. Rows of them, industrial gray, stretching back into the darkness. More documentation than Margaret had ever had, more than Edith could have imagined. A lifetime of records, kept and preserved and hidden beneath a building everyone thought was empty.</p>
            <p>"My God," Sarah whispered.</p>
            <p>She began opening drawers, pulling files, scanning contents by flashlight. Thomas watched her face as she read—the way it changed from disbelief to understanding to something that looked like grief.</p>
            <p>"It's all here," she said. "Shipping manifests. Payment records. Correspondence with military contractors, chemical companies, industrial firms. Fifty years of poison, documented in triplicate." She pulled out another file, another, her movements becoming frantic. "And this—these are disposal maps. Every site in the bay, marked and dated. Site 7 is here, Thomas. It's real. It's—"</p>
            <p>She stopped. Went still. Stared at the document in her hands.</p>
            <p>"What is it?"</p>
            <p>Sarah didn't answer. She handed him the file.</p>
            <p>Thomas looked down at a list of names. Dates. Brief descriptions. <em>Liu, H. - 6/16/62 - Resolved.</em> And below it, others. A dozen names, spanning five decades. People who had asked questions, gathered evidence, threatened the operation. All of them <em>Resolved.</em></p>
            <p>"She killed them all," Sarah said. Her voice was barely a whisper. "My grandmother wasn't the only one. There were others. And they're all—"</p>
            <p><em>Resolved.</em></p>
            <p>Thomas thought about the bones in his net, fifteen years ago. The ones he'd thrown back. Someone's daughter. Someone's mother. Someone who had learned too much and been <em>resolved.</em></p>
            <p>"We need to get out of here," he said. "We need to take what we can carry and—"</p>
            <p>The lights came on.</p>
            <p>The basement flooded with fluorescent glare, blinding after so long in darkness. Thomas threw up a hand, squinting, and through the glare he saw figures at the top of the stairs. Two men in work clothes, their faces blank, their postures professional.</p>
            <p>And behind them, moving with the unhurried precision of someone who had all the time in the world, Eleanor Cross.</p>
            <p>"Dr. Chen," Eleanor said. Her voice echoed in the concrete corridor, pleasant and cold. "Thomas. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this."</p>
            <p>"Eleanor." Thomas stepped in front of Sarah, instinctive, protective. "Let us go. Whatever happens after, let us go now."</p>
            <p>"I'm afraid that's not possible." Eleanor descended the stairs, one careful step at a time, her hand on the railing. She looked old in this light—frailer than she seemed in daylight, the bones of her face showing through paper-thin skin. But her eyes were unchanged: sharp, clear, utterly without mercy.</p>
            <p>"I have copies," Sarah said. Her voice was stronger than Thomas had expected. "Everything I found before—the manifests, the testimony, all of it. If I disappear like my grandmother, it all goes public. You can't stop that."</p>
            <p>"I know." Eleanor reached the bottom of the stairs, stood facing them in the harsh light. "I've known since Margaret told me about your precautions. You've been very thorough, Dr. Chen. More thorough than Helen was. She relied on truth alone; you've relied on redundancy."</p>
            <p>"Then you know killing me doesn't help you."</p>
            <p>"Killing you was never the plan." Eleanor smiled, and it was the saddest smile Thomas had ever seen—the smile of someone at the end of a very long road. "I'm seventy-eight years old. I've been keeping this secret for longer than you've been alive, and I'm tired. So tired." She looked at the filing cabinets, the rows of evidence, the whole documented history of her crimes. "I didn't bring you here to stop you, Dr. Chen. I brought you here to give you what you came for."</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"The full record. Everything. Not just the manifests and the money—the decisions, the reasoning, the names of everyone who was involved at every level. Federal officials, military contractors, the people who built this system and the people who maintained it." Eleanor's voice was steady, measured. "I'm dying. Cancer, since last spring. I have perhaps three months. And I have decided that I will not die with these secrets locked in a basement that nobody knows exists."</p>
            <p>Thomas felt the world shift beneath him—not the physical world, but the world of assumptions, the story he'd told himself for fifty years about Eleanor Cross and what she was capable of.</p>
            <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"Because I'm tired of carrying it." Eleanor looked at him, and for a moment she was just an old woman, exhausted and sick and finished. "I've justified these choices my whole life. I've told myself it was necessary, that I protected this town, that the alternatives were worse. Maybe I was right. Maybe I was wrong. I no longer have the energy to care." She turned back to Sarah. "Take what you need, Dr. Chen. Document it, publish it, bring in your investigators. I'll cooperate with whatever legal proceedings follow. I'll name every name I know, testify to every crime I committed or witnessed."</p>
            <p>"Just like that?"</p>
            <p>"Just like that." Eleanor's smile flickered. "Call it a deathbed conversion. Call it cowardice. Call it the only peace I have left to make." She turned and began climbing the stairs, slowly, the effort visible in every movement. "I'll be at my home when you're ready to begin. The men will help you carry whatever you need."</p>
            <p>She paused at the top of the stairs, looked back down at Sarah standing amid the filing cabinets and the fluorescent light.</p>
            <p>"Your grandmother was right, you know. Truth should have been enough. I spent fifty years proving her wrong, and all I proved was that the lies were heavier than I thought." She turned away. "Don't make my mistakes, Dr. Chen. Don't wait until you're dying to figure out what you should have done all along."</p>
            <p>She walked out, and the two men followed her, and Thomas and Sarah stood alone in the basement with fifty years of secrets waiting to be told.</p>
