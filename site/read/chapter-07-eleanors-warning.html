        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The invitation arrived the next morning, slipped under the research station door sometime before dawn. A single card, cream-colored, expensive paper, handwritten in script so elegant it looked engraved:</p>
            <p><em>Dr. Chen—</em></p>
            <p><em>I believe we should talk. Please join me at the store this afternoon at three. I'll have tea prepared.</em></p>
            <p><em>—Eleanor Cross</em></p>
            <p>No RSVP requested. No option to decline. The phrasing was courteous, the subtext was not.</p>
            <p>Sarah held the card in the gray morning light and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. This was how it had begun for her grandmother. A meeting with Eleanor Cross. A conversation. Three days later, a boat drifting empty.</p>
            <p>She should leave. Pack her samples, load her car, drive south until Saltmere was nothing but a memory and a file she'd hand off to federal investigators. Let someone else finish what she'd started.</p>
            <p>But she thought of Thomas, finally telling the truth after fifty years of silence. Of Margaret, sitting in her ransacked study with hope bleeding out of her eyes. Of Edith, who had kept copies hidden for half a century because she believed someone would eventually come who could use them.</p>
            <p>She thought of her grandmother, who had believed truth was enough.</p>
            <p><em>It wasn't enough</em>, Sarah thought. <em>But maybe I can make it enough this time.</em></p>
            <p>She showered, dressed, ate a breakfast she didn't taste. At two forty-five, she drove into town.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The general store looked different in daylight than it had through fog and windshield glass. A two-story clapboard building, white paint weathered to gray, a covered porch with rocking chairs that no one ever seemed to sit in. The windows displayed the usual small-town inventory: canned goods, hardware, bolts of fabric, a rack of yellowed paperbacks. Everything ordinary, everything innocent.</p>
            <p>Eleanor Cross was waiting on the porch.</p>
            <p>She wore a dress the color of storm clouds, her silver hair pinned up in a style that had been fashionable forty years ago and had somehow never stopped being elegant on her. She sat in one of the rocking chairs, perfectly still, watching Sarah park and approach with the patient attention of a spider who had finished her web and was simply waiting for the vibrations.</p>
            <p>"Dr. Chen." Eleanor's voice was warm, welcoming, utterly at odds with everything Sarah knew about her. "Thank you for coming. I wasn't certain you would."</p>
            <p>"I wasn't certain either." Sarah climbed the porch steps, stopped at a distance she hoped was safely out of reach. "But I decided I'd rather have this conversation than wonder what you wanted to say."</p>
            <p>"Sensible. I appreciate directness." Eleanor gestured to the chair beside her. "Please. Sit. The tea will be ready in a moment."</p>
            <p>Sarah sat. The rocking chair creaked beneath her, a homey sound that did nothing to ease the tension in her spine. From here she could see the harbor, the water gray and flat, the boats at their moorings, the whole town spread out below them like a model someone had built and forgotten to animate.</p>
            <p>"I imagine you've formed opinions about me," Eleanor said. "Based on what you've learned these past few days."</p>
            <p>"I've formed questions."</p>
            <p>"A scientific response. Your grandmother was the same way—she preferred hypotheses to judgments. She said judgments were just hypotheses that had forgotten to be curious." Eleanor's smile was small, private, as if she were remembering something pleasant. "I liked her very much, you know. Helen. She was extraordinary."</p>
            <p>Sarah felt her hands tighten on the arms of the rocking chair. "You knew her."</p>
            <p>"I knew her well. Better than almost anyone in this town, by the end." Eleanor turned to look at Sarah directly, and her eyes were clear and sharp and utterly without shame. "She came to me with her findings, did you know that? Not as an accusation—as an invitation. She thought I might want to help her expose the truth. She thought I might be as horrified as she was by what she'd discovered."</p>
            <p>"Were you?"</p>
            <p>"I was horrified by many things, Dr. Chen. By the poison in our water, by the choices that put it there, by the narrowness of our options. But I was not horrified by the choice itself. That's the difference between people like your grandmother and people like me." Eleanor folded her hands in her lap, composed, unhurried. "Helen believed truth was its own justification. That exposure would lead to accountability, accountability to remediation, remediation to healing. A clean logical chain from revelation to redemption."</p>
            <p>"And you didn't believe that."</p>
            <p>"I believed in consequences. The truth would have destroyed this town, Dr. Chen. Not just reputations, not just the guilty—everyone. The fishermen who'd spent their lives in poisoned water. The children who'd grown up drinking from contaminated wells. The families who'd built homes on land that should have been condemned." Eleanor's voice hardened slightly. "Your grandmother wanted to save the bay. I wanted to save the people who lived beside it. Those goals were not compatible."</p>
            <p>The back door of the store opened, and a young woman emerged with a tea service on a tray—china cups, a silver pot, all of it incongruous against the weathered porch and the gray sky. She set it on the small table between the chairs, poured without being asked, and retreated inside without a word.</p>
            <p>"Sugar?" Eleanor asked, as if they were discussing nothing more significant than refreshments.</p>
            <p>"No. Thank you." Sarah didn't touch the cup. "You said you wanted to talk. So talk."</p>
            <p>Eleanor lifted her own tea, took a delicate sip, set it down precisely in its saucer. Every motion controlled, deliberate, a performance of calm that had been perfected over decades.</p>
            <p>"I want to offer you what I offered your grandmother. A choice." She turned those sharp eyes on Sarah again. "You've gathered evidence. Copies of documents, testimony from people who've decided that conscience weighs more than consequences. You believe you're building something that will finally bring accountability to what happened here."</p>
            <p>"Am I wrong?"</p>
            <p>"You're thorough. Your grandmother would be proud." Eleanor's expression flickered—something that might have been respect, or might have been its opposite. "But you're also naive, in exactly the way she was. You believe the truth will matter. You believe that documentation and testimony will outweigh sixty years of silence, millions of dollars in liability, federal agencies that would prefer this stay buried forever."</p>
            <p>"I believe in trying."</p>
            <p>"So did Helen." Eleanor set down her teacup with a soft click. "I'm going to tell you something I've never told anyone, Dr. Chen. Not because I expect it to change your mind, but because I think you deserve to know what you're dealing with."</p>
            <p>Sarah waited. The fog had begun to creep in from the water, softening the edges of the town below, muting colors, blurring lines.</p>
            <p>"The disposal operation wasn't my idea. It wasn't my husband's. It was the government's." Eleanor's voice was matter-of-fact, almost bored. "The military needed a site on the Pacific coast. Somewhere remote, somewhere that could be controlled, somewhere that could be denied if necessary. My husband had done work for them during the war—I never knew the details, and I never asked. When they approached us with the proposal, we were given a choice: cooperate and prosper, or refuse and watch them find another way that would leave us with nothing."</p>
            <p>"You're saying you were coerced."</p>
            <p>"I'm saying we were presented with reality. The disposal was going to happen somewhere. The only question was whether Saltmere would benefit from it or be destroyed by it." Eleanor smiled thinly. "We chose to benefit. We used the money to keep this town alive for fifty years. Every road, every school repair, every fishing boat that didn't go bankrupt—that was the disposal money. That was the cost we paid."</p>
            <p>"And my grandmother? Was she part of that cost?"</p>
            <p>The silence stretched. Eleanor's face remained composed, but something shifted behind her eyes—a door opening onto a room she usually kept locked.</p>
            <p>"Your grandmother gave me an ultimatum. She said she would publish her findings within the week unless I agreed to help her expose everything. I tried to explain what I've explained to you—that the truth would destroy more than it saved. She didn't listen." Eleanor's voice dropped, became almost gentle. "I told her she needed to leave Saltmere. I told her she needed to stop asking questions and go back to her university and forget what she'd found. I told her that the people who had made this arrangement would not allow it to be exposed, and that her life was in danger."</p>
            <p>"And?"</p>
            <p>"And she didn't believe me. Or she believed me and didn't care." Eleanor picked up her tea again, held it without drinking. "Three days later, she was gone. I did not order her death, Dr. Chen. I did not arrange it. But I knew it was coming, and I did not prevent it. In the eyes of God and the law, I suppose that makes me guilty. In my own eyes—" She paused. "In my own eyes, I did what I had to do to protect my town. I have lived with that choice for fifty years. I will die with it, probably soon. And I will not apologize for it."</p>
            <p>Sarah realized she was gripping the arms of the rocking chair hard enough to hurt. She forced herself to let go, to breathe, to think past the roar of blood in her ears.</p>
            <p>"Why are you telling me this?"</p>
            <p>"Because I want you to understand what you're choosing. Your grandmother chose truth over safety, and she died for it. Margaret Holloway chose to help you, and now she has nothing—no files, no protection, no way forward. Thomas Breck has chosen to talk, and when this is over, he will lose everything he's spent his life building." Eleanor leaned forward, and her voice was almost kind. "You can still leave, Dr. Chen. You can take your samples and your notes and go back to your university and write a report that no one will read. You can live your life. You can have children, grandchildren, a career, a death in your own bed surrounded by people who love you."</p>
            <p>"Or?"</p>
            <p>"Or you can stay. You can keep digging. You can try to build a case that will stand up against federal agencies and corporate lawyers and sixty years of silence." Eleanor's eyes held Sarah's. "And you will fail. Not because you're not smart enough or brave enough—you are both. But because the people who benefit from this secret have more resources, more patience, and more willingness to do whatever is necessary than you can possibly imagine. Your grandmother learned that. I would prefer that you didn't have to."</p>
            <p>Sarah stood. Her legs were unsteady, but she made herself stand anyway, made herself look down at Eleanor Cross with as much composure as she could muster.</p>
            <p>"Thank you for the tea," she said. "And thank you for your honesty. It's clarified something I was uncertain about."</p>
            <p>"What's that?"</p>
            <p>"My grandmother died believing truth was enough. You've spent fifty years believing it wasn't." Sarah turned toward the porch steps, then paused. "But you're wrong about one thing. You said I'll fail because the people who benefit from this secret have more resources and more patience. You forgot something."</p>
            <p>"What's that?"</p>
            <p>"I don't have to win. I just have to make sure the truth outlives me." Sarah walked down the steps into the thickening fog. "And I've already done that."</p>
            <p>She didn't look back. She could feel Eleanor's eyes on her, that patient predator attention, all the way to her car.</p>
            <p>The research station was dark when she arrived.</p>
            <p>The door was open.</p>
            <p>Inside, everything she'd left behind—her equipment, her samples, her backup copies—was gone.</p>
