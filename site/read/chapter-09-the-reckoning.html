            <p>They worked through the night.</p>
            <p>Thomas carried boxes while Sarah photographed and catalogued, building an inventory of fifty years of crimes. The two men Eleanor had left behind—neither of them spoke, neither offered their names—helped without being asked, moving with the mechanical efficiency of people who had stopped asking questions long ago.</p>
            <p>By dawn, they had filled Thomas's truck twice over. The research station was gone, but Margaret had opened her house—the same house that had been ransacked two nights before, now cleared of debris and waiting like a wound that refused to close.</p>
            <p>"I don't understand," Margaret said, when they arrived with the first load. She stood in her doorway in a bathrobe, her face gray with exhaustion and confusion. "Eleanor just... gave it to you?"</p>
            <p>"She's dying," Sarah said. "Cancer. She says she's tired of carrying it."</p>
            <p>"Eleanor Cross has never been tired of anything in her life."</p>
            <p>"People change. At the end." Thomas set down a box of files, felt his back protest. "Or maybe they just stop pretending."</p>
            <p>Margaret looked at the boxes filling her living room, the documentation her father had helped create, the evidence of crimes she'd spent her whole life not-seeing. Something moved in her face—not grief exactly, but something close to it. The complicated sorrow of discovering that the monster you'd feared was also just a person, dying and scared and looking for absolution.</p>
            <p>"I should have done this years ago," she said quietly. "I had his files. I knew what was in them. I could have—"</p>
            <p>"You couldn't have." Sarah touched her arm, gentle. "Eleanor would have stopped you the same way she stopped everyone else. The only reason this is happening now is because she's decided to let it happen."</p>
            <p>"That doesn't make me feel better."</p>
            <p>"It's not supposed to." Sarah turned back to the boxes. "It's just true."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The full scope of the operation became clear over the following days.</p>
            <p>The Saltmere Cannery had processed waste from seventeen different military and industrial sources over a twenty-two-year period. The materials included chemical weapons components, radioactive isotopes, industrial solvents, and biological research byproducts—things the government couldn't admit existed, things corporations couldn't legally dispose of, things that had to disappear without paperwork or witnesses.</p>
            <p>The bay had received over four thousand individual deposits. The deep channel alone contained enough toxic material to contaminate the water table for a hundred miles in any direction. Site 7—the location Thomas had visited as a teenager, the location marked in Robert Holloway's log—was the repository for materials too dangerous even for the regular dumps: concentrated chemical agents, failed weapons prototypes, and, according to Eleanor's records, fourteen human bodies.</p>
            <p>Fourteen people who had learned too much. Fourteen names on a list marked <em>Resolved.</em></p>
            <p>Helen Liu was the seventh.</p>
            <p>Sarah found her grandmother's file on the third day of cataloguing. A thin folder, clinical in its brevity: name, date of arrival, nature of threat, recommended action, outcome. Helen had been classified as a "Category A exposure"—someone with both knowledge and intent to disclose. The recommended action was "permanent resolution." The outcome was a single word: <em>Completed.</em></p>
            <p>Below that, in different handwriting—Eleanor's, Sarah now recognized—a note: <em>Regrettable. She would have been useful.</em></p>
            <p>Sarah sat with that file for a long time, in the gray light of Margaret's living room, surrounded by boxes of evidence and the accumulated weight of half a century of silence. She didn't cry. She'd expected to cry, had prepared herself for the grief of finally knowing. But what she felt instead was something colder, harder—a clarity that had burned away everything soft.</p>
            <p>Her grandmother had been murdered for asking questions. For believing truth mattered. For trusting that evidence and courage would be enough against people who had decided that some secrets were worth killing for.</p>
            <p><em>Regrettable</em>, Eleanor had written. <em>She would have been useful.</em></p>
            <p>Sarah closed the file and went back to work.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>On the fourth day, the federal investigators arrived.</p>
            <p>Sarah had made calls on the second day, once she'd understood the scope of what they'd found. Not local authorities—Eleanor's reach extended too far, and anyway the local sheriff had his own file in the cabinet, his own history of looking the other way. She'd called the EPA's criminal division, the FBI's environmental crimes unit, a journalist at the Seattle Times who'd been covering industrial pollution for twenty years. She'd called everyone she could think of who might care, who might listen, who might be powerful enough to see this through.</p>
            <p>The EPA sent three investigators. The FBI sent two. The journalist came alone, with a photographer and a recorder and the hungry attention of someone who had finally found the story she'd been looking for her whole career.</p>
            <p>They took over Margaret's house, then the town hall, then the cannery itself. They brought equipment Sarah didn't recognize, personnel in hazmat suits, boats with sonar and diving gear. They began mapping the disposal sites, taking samples, building a case that would eventually reach from Saltmere to Seattle to Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>Eleanor cooperated with everything.</p>
            <p>She sat for interviews that lasted hours, answered questions with the precise memory of someone who had spent fifty years keeping track of every detail. She named names—military officials, corporate executives, government liaisons, the whole network of people who had built and maintained and profited from the operation. She signed statements, provided documents, testified to crimes that would send dozens of people to prison.</p>
            <p>"Why are you doing this?" Sarah asked her, on the fifth day, in the living room of Eleanor's house where they'd first had tea. The house was different now—smaller somehow, diminished by the presence of federal agents cataloguing its contents. Eleanor sat in the same chair she'd always sat in, but she looked like a woman waiting for a train that was running late.</p>
            <p>"I told you. I'm tired."</p>
            <p>"That's not enough. You've spent your whole life protecting this. You've killed people to protect it. And now you're just... giving it away?"</p>
            <p>Eleanor was quiet for a moment. Outside, Sarah could hear the sounds of the investigation—vehicles coming and going, voices calling to each other, the machinery of justice finally grinding into motion.</p>
            <p>"When my husband died," Eleanor said finally, "he asked me to take care of the town. Not the operation—the town. The people who lived here, the families who depended on us, the community he'd spent his life building. I promised him I would."</p>
            <p>"And the operation was how you kept that promise."</p>
            <p>"The operation was how I kept everyone fed. How I kept the schools open, the fishing fleet running, the young people from leaving for cities that didn't want them." Eleanor's voice was steady, matter-of-fact. "I made a calculation, Dr. Chen. The harm of the disposal against the good of the money. The lives lost against the lives saved. I decided the math worked out in our favor."</p>
            <p>"And now?"</p>
            <p>"Now I'm dying, and I've had time to reconsider my arithmetic." Eleanor smiled, and it was the first genuine smile Sarah had seen from her—wry, self-aware, touched with something that might have been regret. "The water is poisoned. The fish are gone. The young people left anyway. The town I was trying to save is dying, and it's dying because of what I did to save it." She looked at Sarah directly. "Your grandmother was right. The truth should have come out fifty years ago. It would have been painful, but it would have been honest. Instead I chose deception, and all I bought was time. Time for the poison to spread. Time for more people to die. Time for the lie to become so large that the truth might not be enough to save anything at all."</p>
            <p>"So this is penance."</p>
            <p>"This is arithmetic. The calculation changed." Eleanor folded her hands in her lap. "I can't undo what I did. I can't bring back your grandmother, or the others. But I can make sure the truth survives me. I can make sure the people who benefited from this—the government officials, the corporate executives, all the people who got rich while Saltmere got sick—I can make sure they face consequences."</p>
            <p>"Even though it means facing consequences yourself."</p>
            <p>"I'm dying, Dr. Chen. The only consequence that matters to me anymore is what people say after I'm gone." Eleanor's eyes drifted to the window, to the gray water of the bay she'd spent her life poisoning and protecting. "I'd like them to say I told the truth, in the end. It's not much. But it's something."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Thomas found Sarah on the dock that evening, the same spot where he'd found her after the research station was ransacked. She was watching the boats go out—not fishing boats anymore, but federal vessels, their lights blinking in the growing dark as they surveyed the dump sites.</p>
            <p>"They're saying it'll take years to clean up," he said, settling beside her. "If it can be cleaned up at all."</p>
            <p>"I know."</p>
            <p>"They're saying some of the contamination has reached the groundwater. The whole aquifer might be compromised."</p>
            <p>"I know."</p>
            <p>Thomas lit a cigarette, watched the smoke curl up into the evening air. The fog was holding off tonight—unusual for this time of year, as if even the weather knew something had changed.</p>
            <p>"I threw those bones back," he said quietly. "Fifteen years ago. I've thought about it every day since. Wondered who they were, whether they had family somewhere, whether anyone was still looking for them."</p>
            <p>"You'll probably find out now."</p>
            <p>"Yeah." He took a long drag. "Not sure if that makes it better or worse. Knowing."</p>
            <p>They sat in silence for a while, listening to the water, the distant hum of the investigation, the sounds of a town trying to figure out what it was now that its oldest secret was finally being told.</p>
            <p>"My grandmother would have liked you," Sarah said finally.</p>
            <p>"You think so?"</p>
            <p>"She believed in people who told the truth, even when it was hard. Even when it cost them." Sarah looked at him. "You're the reason this is happening, Thomas. You brought me that cylinder. You told me about Eleanor. You showed me Site 7. Without you, I would have failed like she did."</p>
            <p>"I just stopped being a coward. Fifty years too late."</p>
            <p>"Better late than never." Sarah stood, brushed off her jeans. "That's what my grandmother would have said. Better late than never."</p>
            <p>She walked back toward Margaret's house, toward the boxes of evidence and the federal agents and the long work of justice that was finally, finally beginning.</p>
            <p>Thomas stayed on the dock a while longer, smoking and watching the lights on the water, thinking about bones and secrets and the strange arithmetic of a life spent looking the other way.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow there would be more questions. More interviews. More of the painful process of admitting what he'd known and when he'd known it. His name would be in the papers, his face on the news, his complicity part of the public record forever.</p>
            <p>But tonight the water was calm, and the stars were clear, and somewhere out in the bay the truth was finally rising to the surface.</p>
            <p>It wasn't redemption. Thomas knew better than to call it that.</p>
            <p>But it was something.</p>
