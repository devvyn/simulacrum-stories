        <div class="content">
            <p>Thomas Breck had pulled strange things from his nets before.</p>
            <p>In forty-three years of fishing, the sea had offered up boots and bicycles, a refrigerator door, half a mannequin, waterlogged books with no readable text, a wedding dress still on its hanger, car parts, boat parts, pieces of things he couldn't identify and didn't want to. The deep channel was a graveyard of everything the land wanted to forget, and the currents had a way of surfacing objects decades after they'd been consigned to darkness.</p>
            <p>But he'd never pulled up anything like this.</p>
            <p>The cylinder had come up tangled in his nets that morning, a few miles east of his usual route. He'd been running a new line—the old waters were fished out, had been for years—and the nets had snagged on something heavy enough to strain the winch. When he'd finally hauled the catch aboard, most of it was kelp and debris, the usual garbage of a dying bay. But nested in the mess, half-buried in rotting seaweed, was the cylinder.</p>
            <p>Steel. Military green, though the paint had faded to something closer to gray. About two feet long, eight inches in diameter, with markings stamped into the metal that he couldn't quite read through the corrosion. Heavy—maybe forty pounds—and sealed at both ends with caps that looked designed to survive anything.</p>
            <p>Thomas sat on the deck of <em>Nothing Personal</em>, engine idling, and stared at the thing for a long time.</p>
            <p>He knew what it was. Not specifically—he couldn't read the faded stencils, couldn't identify the contents—but he knew what it meant. This wasn't industrial waste from factories up the coast. This was something else. Something the government made, and the government wanted gone.</p>
            <p>He thought about throwing it back.</p>
            <p>He'd done it before. Fifteen years ago, when his nets had brought up something worse than a cylinder. Something that had once been a person, or part of one, bones and remnants held together by nothing but the net itself. He'd stood on this same deck, in this same gray light, and made a choice that had lived in his chest ever since like a stone he couldn't cough up.</p>
            <p>He'd thrown it back. He'd told no one. He'd kept fishing.</p>
            <p>Now here was the sea, offering him another choice.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah Chen was at the research station when he arrived, bent over her sample equipment, making notes in a hand so precise it looked printed. She looked up when his truck pulled in, and something in her face shifted—recognition, maybe, or the particular alertness of someone who'd learned to expect trouble.</p>
            <p>"Thomas." She set down her pen. "I wasn't expecting you."</p>
            <p>"I wasn't expecting to come." He climbed out of the truck, walked around to the bed, and pulled back the tarp he'd used to cover the cylinder. "But I found something. Thought you should see it before I decide what to do with it."</p>
            <p>Sarah came to look, and he watched her face as understanding arrived. The way her eyes went first to the shape, then to the markings, then to him with a question she was afraid to ask.</p>
            <p>"Where did you find this?"</p>
            <p>"East of the channel. New line I was trying." He rested his hands on the side of the truck bed. "Came up in the nets this morning. I've never seen anything like it."</p>
            <p>Sarah reached out, touched the cylinder's surface, traced the faded stencils with her fingertips. Her mouth moved slightly, reading something he couldn't make out.</p>
            <p>"This is military surplus," she said quietly. "Chemical containers. The kind they used for—" She stopped. "I need to look at this inside. Can you help me carry it?"</p>
            <p>They moved the cylinder to the lab bench, Sarah clearing space with quick, nervous efficiency. She photographed it from multiple angles, measured its dimensions, scraped samples of the corrosion into collection vials. Thomas watched her work, saying nothing, remembering another scientist who'd worked with the same focused intensity in these same waters.</p>
            <p>"The manifests," Sarah said, half to herself. "Edith's copies. There were entries I couldn't identify—shipments with no origin listed, no contents specified. I thought they were just sloppy record-keeping." She looked at Thomas. "They weren't sloppy. They were classified."</p>
            <p>"Meaning?"</p>
            <p>"Meaning the Saltmere dumping operation wasn't just industrial waste." Sarah's voice was steady, but her hands weren't. "Someone was using this bay to dispose of military materials. Chemical weapons, maybe. Biological agents. Things the government couldn't admit existed."</p>
            <p>Thomas felt the stone in his chest shift, grow heavier. "You're saying the water isn't just poisoned. It's—"</p>
            <p>"I don't know what it is. Not yet." Sarah turned to face him fully. "But I know this changes everything. This isn't just a local conspiracy anymore. This is federal. If the military was involved, if there are more of these in the channel—"</p>
            <p>"There are." The words came out before Thomas could stop them. "I've seen them on sonar. Dozens of contacts, maybe more. I always thought they were natural formations, rock outcrops. But they're not, are they? They're containers. Like this one."</p>
            <p>Sarah was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was careful. "Why didn't you report this before?"</p>
            <p>"Because I wanted to keep fishing." Thomas heard the shame in his own voice and didn't try to hide it. "Because I have a boat and a license and what's left of a livelihood, and I knew—I knew—that if anyone looked too closely at what's in that channel, they'd shut it down. They'd shut everything down. And then what would I be?"</p>
            <p>"You'd be someone who told the truth."</p>
            <p>"The truth doesn't pay for fuel. The truth doesn't keep a roof over your head." He turned away, looked out the window at the gray water. "I've been lying to myself for years, Dr. Chen. Pretending the catches were just bad, pretending the water was just changing, pretending I didn't know what I knew. Your grandmother asked me questions fifty years ago, and I didn't answer them honestly then either."</p>
            <p>"What did she ask?"</p>
            <p>"She asked if I'd seen anything strange in the nets. Containers, debris, things that didn't belong." Thomas closed his eyes. "I was seventeen. I'd been fishing with my father since I was nine. I knew the answer was yes, and I told her no. Because my father had told me to. Because the whole town had decided what we were going to say and not say, and I was too young and too scared to break ranks."</p>
            <p>When he opened his eyes, Sarah was standing beside him. Close enough to touch, though she didn't.</p>
            <p>"You're telling me now," she said.</p>
            <p>"I'm seventy years old. My father's dead. My son's gone, my grandson barely knows me, the fish are gone, and the water's poison. I've got nothing left to protect except whatever's left of my soul." He turned to face her. "I threw something back once. Something I should have reported. I've lived with that choice for fifteen years. I'm not making it again."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>They talked for two hours, Thomas telling her everything he'd never told anyone: the shapes on the sonar, the debris in the nets, the night operations he'd witnessed as a teenager when unmarked trucks would arrive at the cannery pier and his father would take them out on the water with no running lights. The way the whole town knew and didn't know, the way silence had become so habitual it no longer felt like a choice.</p>
            <p>Sarah listened without judgment, without interruption. She took notes, asked clarifying questions, treated his confession like data—which, he realized, was a kindness. She was letting him be a witness rather than an accomplice.</p>
            <p>When he finally ran out of words, she sat back and looked at the cylinder on the bench.</p>
            <p>"Site 7," she said. "Edith found a reference in the harbor master's log. June 1962, the day before my grandmother disappeared. Special disposal, no manifest, E.C. authorization."</p>
            <p>"Eleanor Cross."</p>
            <p>"Do you know where Site 7 is?"</p>
            <p>Thomas was quiet for a long moment. The answer lived in his memory like a splinter—something he'd tried to forget, something that had worked its way deeper instead.</p>
            <p>"My father took me there once," he said finally. "I was maybe fourteen. Late at night, no moon. Eleanor was in the boat with us—the only time I ever saw her on the water. We anchored over a spot in the deep channel, deeper than anywhere we usually fished. There were already drums there—I could see them on the bottom when my father shone the light down. And Eleanor... she dropped something over the side. Something wrapped in canvas. Heavy. She said a few words I couldn't hear, and then we went home."</p>
            <p>"Can you find it again?"</p>
            <p>"I've been avoiding that spot for fifty-six years, Dr. Chen. Yes. I can find it."</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Sarah walked him to his truck as the afternoon light began to fade. The fog was creeping back in, softening the edges of the world, and Thomas thought about all the things that happened in this town when the fog was thick enough to hide them.</p>
            <p>"Thank you," Sarah said. "For bringing me this. For telling me what you know."</p>
            <p>"Don't thank me yet. I haven't done anything except talk." He opened the truck door, then paused. "There's something else. Something I should have mentioned before."</p>
            <p>"What?"</p>
            <p>"That meeting your grandmother had with Eleanor. The one I told you about." Thomas gripped the door frame. "I said I saw them talking in Eleanor's car. What I didn't say was what happened after."</p>
            <p>Sarah waited.</p>
            <p>"After Helen got out of the car, Eleanor sat there for a while. Just sat. And then she turned and looked right at me—I was on the dock, thought I was hidden behind some crates, but she saw me anyway. She looked at me for maybe ten seconds, and then she smiled." Thomas felt the memory like ice on his skin. "It wasn't a threatening smile. It was worse. It was the smile of someone who knows exactly what's going to happen and isn't worried about witnesses."</p>
            <p>He climbed into the truck, started the engine.</p>
            <p>"Be careful, Dr. Chen. Eleanor's been winning this game for longer than you've been alive. She doesn't lose because she doesn't leave loose ends."</p>
            <p>He drove away into the fog, and in his rearview mirror Sarah stood alone in front of the research station, growing smaller and smaller until the gray swallowed her whole.</p>
